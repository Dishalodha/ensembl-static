This repository replaces the Drupal backend for non-vertebrate static content used on the five divisional websites:

* bacteria.ensembl.org
* fungi.ensembl.org
* metazoa.ensembl.org
* plants.ensembl.org
* protists.ensembl.org

Site homepage content is stored for all divisions, and for all except bacteria, descriptions and annotation information for all species.
