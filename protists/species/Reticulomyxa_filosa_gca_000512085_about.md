About *Reticulomyxa filosa* 
---------------------------



***Reticulomyxa*** is a monospecific genus of freshwater foraminiferans.
The organism has unique bidirectional cytoplasmic streaming throughout
the anastomosing pseudopodia that is some of the fastest reported
organelle transport observed. *Reticulomyxa* was first described in 1949
and is commonly used as a model organism for the unique transport of
organelles throughout the cytoplasm of pseudopodia by cytoskeletal
mechanisms. Only asexual reproduction of this genus has been observed in
culture, but the genome possesses genes related to meiosis suggesting it
is capable of sexually reproductive life stages.
