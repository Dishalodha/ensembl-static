About *Eimeria acervulina* 
--------------------------



***Eimeria acervulina*** is a species of *Eimeria* that causes
coccidiosis in older poultry. Lesions are limited to the anterior or
first third of the small intestine. Diagnosis is made by on necropsy
based on location and the pathognomic white to gray striations that
appear on the mucosa or inner surface of the small intestine. Scrapings
of the mucosa from diseased birds can reveal oocysts.
