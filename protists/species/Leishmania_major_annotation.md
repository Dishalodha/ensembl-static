Annotation
----------

The genome annotation for the Freidlin strain of the *L. major* genome
has been derived from the data submitted to the ENA by
[GeneDB](http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Lmajor) where the latest
sequence data and annotation is constantly updated and enhanced by
importing data from additional sources, principally UniProtKB and GOA.
The GeneDB records were submitted by The *Leishmania major* Friedlin
consortium which consists of The European *Leishmania major* Friedlin
Genome Sequencing
Consortium([EULEISH](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/L_major/EUseqlabs.shtml)),
the [Seattle Biomedical Research Institute
(SBRI)](http://apps.sbri.org/genome/lmjf/Lmjf.aspx), and [The Sanger
Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/L_major/).
