*G. lamblia* (ATCC 50803) strain WB, clone C6 genome was sequenced to
11.3 coverage using the whole genome shotgun method. It is 12 Mb in size
and contains 6488 predicted open reading frames distributed throughout
five chromosomes (chromosome polymorphism has been identified in
different strains) and more than 13,100 predicted proteins. Karyotyping
studies found chromosome sizes to range from 1.6 to over 3.8 Mb. It is
available from the EMBL/Genbank/DDBJ databases under the accession
[GCA\_000002435.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000002435.1){.constant}
