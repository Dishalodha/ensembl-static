Annotation
----------

The protein-coding gene annotation of the *Paramecium tetraurelia*
genome has been imported from that submitted to the [European Nucleotide
Archive](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena)
([GCA\_000165425](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000165425)).

Non-coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
