About the *Thalassiosira pseudonana* genome
-------------------------------------------

*Thalassiosira pseudonana*is a centric diatom that belongs to the
diverse algal group, likely arose from a common secondary endosymbiotic
event, involving at least five different genomes. Diatoms are involved
in various biogeochemical cycles most notably involving carbon, nitrogen
and silicon, and contribute 30% to 40% of marine primary productivity.
Consequently, they are responsible for approximately one fifth of the
oxygen that is generated each year through global photosynthesis.
