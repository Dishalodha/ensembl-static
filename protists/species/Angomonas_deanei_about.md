About *Angomonas deanei* 
------------------------



***Angomonas deanei*** is a flagellated trypanosomatid protozoan. It is
an obligate parasite in the gastrointestinal tract of insects, and is in
turn a host to symbiotic bacteria. In fact the endosymbiont maintains a
permanent mutualistic relationship with the bacterium such that the
bacterium is no longer able to reproduce and survive on its own.

The species name was accepted as *Crithidia deanei* until 2011, when
phylogenetic analysis revealed that it belongs to the genus *Angomonas*,
thereby becoming *Angomonas deanei*. The symbiotic bacterium is a member
of the Î²-proteobacterium that descended from the common ancestor with
the genus *Bordetella*, or more likely, *Taylorella*. The two organisms
have depended on each other so much that the bacterium cannot reproduce
and the protozoan can no longer infect insects when they are isolated.
Thus, this organismal association is a fine model for the evidence of
the endosymbiotic theory in nature, which explains the origin of
eukaryotic cell organelles such as mitochondria and plastids from
individual prokaryotes.
