About the *Bigelowiella natans* genome
--------------------------------------

*Bigelowiella natans* belongs to the eukaryotic \'supergroup\' Rhizaria
and it is a chlorarachniophyte alga. The chlorarachniophyte alga still
possess the nucleomorph, nucleus from the endosymbiotic event in a
highly reduced and simplified form. Proteins that function in the
plastid of Bigelowiella natans are encoded in 3 separate genomes: the
nucleus, the nucleomorph, and the plastid itself. The *B.natans* genome
help in better understanding of the secondary endosymbiotic event.
