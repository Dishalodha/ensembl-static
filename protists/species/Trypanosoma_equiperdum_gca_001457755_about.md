About *Trypanosoma equiperdum* 
------------------------------



***Î¤rypanosoma equiperdum*** is a species of kinetoplastid parasites
that causes Dourine or covering sickness in horses and other animals in
the family equidae. *T. equiperdum* is the only trypanosome that is not
spread by an insect vector. *T. equiperdum* is unique in that its
kinetoplast, the network of connected rings that make up its
mitochondrial DNA, consists of thousands of \"minicircles\" that are
identical in sequence.
