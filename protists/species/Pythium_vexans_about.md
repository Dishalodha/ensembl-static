About the *Pythium vexans* Genome
---------------------------------

*Pythium vexans* is a plant pathogen and it causes canker, damping-off
and rot disease in many economically important crops including rubber
trees, potato and sugar cane. It belongs to the group oomycetes which
was originally classified among the fungi, due to its morphological and
functional similarities. They are now classifed as protists based on
modern insights on phylogentic relationship with photosynthetic
organisms such as brown algae and diatoms.
