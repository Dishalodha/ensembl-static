[[*Fragilariopsis cylindrus* is a cold-water diatom found in Arctic and
Antarctic sea water and sea ice. It can form large ice-edge blooms and
is regularly detected in sea ice investigations. To date, prokaryotes
are the only psychrophilic (cold-loving) organisms for which whole
genome sequences exist. The whole genome sequencing of *F. cylindrus*
will provide the first insights into a psychrophilic eukaryotic organism
with compelling ecological and biotechnological
applications.]{style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"}]{style="font-size:11px"}
