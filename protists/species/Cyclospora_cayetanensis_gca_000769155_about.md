***Cyclospora cayetanensis*** is a parasite that causes disease in
humans, and, perhaps, in other primates. It has been linked in the
United States to fecally contaminated imported produce, and was
virtually unknown before about 1990, but has been on the rise since. The
health risk associated with the disease is usually confined to adult
foreigners visiting regions where the species is endemic and acquiring
the infection; consequently, *C. cayetanensis* is a cause of
\"traveler\'s diarrhea\".

This species was placed in the genus *Cyclospora* because of the
spherical shape of its sporocysts. The species name refers to the
Cayetano Heredia University in Lima, Peru, where early epidemiological
and taxonomic work was done.
