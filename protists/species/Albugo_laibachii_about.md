About the *Albugo laibachii* genome
-----------------------------------

Albugo laibachii is a pathogen of the model plant *Arabidopsis
thaliana*. This pathogen and *[Hyaloperonospora
arabidopsidis](http://protists.ensembl.org/Hyaloperonospora_arabidopsidis/Info/Index/)*
are regularly found to co-infect plants and sporulate on the same leaf.
A remarkable consequence of infection by *Albugo* sp. is enhanced host
plant susceptibility to other parasites to which the host is resistant
in the absence of *Albugo* infection, and also impairment of cell death
mechanisms.
