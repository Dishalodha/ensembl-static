***Leishmania infantum*** is the causative agent of infantile visceral
leishmaniasis in the Mediterranean region of the Old World and in Latin
America, where it has been called *Leishmania chagasi*. It is also an
unusual cause of cutaneous leishmaniasis, which is normally caused by
specific lineages (or zymodemes). Wild canids and domestic dogs are the
natural reservoir of this organism. *Leishmania infantum* is closely
related to *Leishmania donovani*, and some authors believe that these
two species are so close as to actually be subspecies of each other;
however, phylogenetic analyses can easily distinguish between the two
groups, although analysis has shown that some isolates of *Leishmania
donovani* have been classified as *Leishmania infantum* and that the
former includes a number of different genetic groups.
