About *Fonticula alba str. ATCC 38817* 
--------------------------------------



***Fonticula*** is a genus of cellular slime mold which forms a fruiting
body in a volcano shape. In 1979, *Fonticula* was made a new genus of
its own due to the unique characteristics of its fruiting body, with
only one species: *Fonticula alba*.

The life cycle of *Fonticula alba* alternates between an amoeboid
vegetative stage and aggregative fruiting stage. The fruiting body of
the genus has a unique shape, as its sorocarp resembles a volcano and
sorus looks like a ball of hot lava emerging from that volcano.

Molecular phylogenies have found alignments in genes of *Fonticula alba*
to subgroups in Opisthokonta. A 2009 study has found that *Fonticula* is
the sister taxa to *Nuclearia*, thus making it related to the kingdom
Fungi.

*Fonticula*, *Nuclearia*, and Fungi have been united into the
Holomycota, which is sister to the Holozoa.
