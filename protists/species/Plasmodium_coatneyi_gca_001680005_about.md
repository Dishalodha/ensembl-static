About *Plasmodium coatneyi* 
---------------------------



***Plasmodium coatneyi*** is a parasitic species that is an agent of
malaria in nonhuman primates. *P. coatneyi* occurs in Southeast Asia.
The natural host of this species is the rhesus macaque (*Macaca
mulatta*) and crab-eating macaque (*Macaca fascicularis fascicularis*),
but there has been no evidence that zoonosis of *P. coatneyi* can occur
through its vector, the female *Anopheles* mosquito.

While *P. coatneyi* cannot be transmitted to humans, it is similar
enough to *Plasmodium falciparum* to warrant laboratory study as a model
species.
