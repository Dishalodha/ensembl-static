***Dictyostelium purpureum*** is a species of *Dictyostelium*.

*D. purpureum* is a distinct species from *D. discoideum*, although it
belongs in the same phenotypic grouping. Like *D. discoideum*, it
exhibits a robust multicellular life cycle, and shares some of the early
signaling molecules with *D. discoideum*. Both species spend vegetative
growth preying on bacteria in the soil, and when starved, aggregate to
enter multicellular development that culminates into a fruiting body
with resistant viable spores (*D. purpureum* is so named for its
strikingly purple spores), and supporting stalk structures.
