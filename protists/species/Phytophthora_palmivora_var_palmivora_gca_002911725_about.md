***Phytophthora palmivora*** is an oomycete that causes bud-rot of
palms, fruit-rot or kole-roga of coconut and areca nut. These are among
the most serious diseases caused by fungi and moulds in South India. It
occurs almost every year in Malnad, Mysore, North & South Kanara,
Malabar and other areas. Similar diseases of palms are also known to
occur in Sri Lanka, Mauritius, and Sumatra. The causative organism was
first identified as *Phytophthora palmivora* by Edwin John Butler in
1917.
