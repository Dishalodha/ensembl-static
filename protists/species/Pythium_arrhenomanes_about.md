About the *Pythium arrhenomanes* Genome
---------------------------------------

*Pythium arrhenomanes* is the causal agent of root rot on many Poaceae
crops. *P. arrhenomanes* is an important seedling rice pathogen. It is
isolated frequently from corn (*Zea mays*) roots in corn-soybean
(*Glycine max*) rotation plots and in irrigated plots of continuous
corn.

It belongs to the group oomycetes which was originally classified among
the fungi, due to its morphological and functional similarities. They
are now classifed as protists based on modern insights on phylogentic
relationship with photosynthetic organisms such as brown algae and
diatoms.
