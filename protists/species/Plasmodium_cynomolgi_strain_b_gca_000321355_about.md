About *Plasmodium cynomolgi strain B* 
-------------------------------------



***Plasmodium cynomolgi*** is an apicomplexan parasite that infects
mosquitoes and Asian Old World monkeys. This species has been used as a
model for human *Plasmodium vivax* because *Plasmodium cynomolgi* shares
the same life cycle and some important biological features with *P.
vivax*.
