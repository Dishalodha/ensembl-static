*Pseudo-nitzschia multistriata* is a marine planktonic pennate diatom
capable of producing the neurotoxin domoic acid, a molecule that can
contaminate seafood and cause a syndrome called amnesic shellfish
poisoning. The life cycle of this species includes a sexual phase and
its genetics are controllable. The availability of a sequenced genome
for *Pseudo-nitzschia multistriata* will contribute to consolidate it as a
model species for diatoms. *Pseudo-nitzschia multistriata* can be
transformed, therefore functional genomics approaches to study gene
function are possible. These tools will allow to explore the mechanisms
of toxin production and other molecular processes specific to diatoms,
one of the major and most important groups of unicellular
microalgae.
