About the *Phytophtora sojae* genome
------------------------------------

*Phytophthora sojae* is an oomycete and a soil-borne plant pathogen that
causes \'damping off\' seedlings and root rot of adult soybean plants.
This is a prevalent disease in most soybean growing regions, and a major
cause of crop loss. Central to the infection process are the zoopores
that are produced in wet conditions and move in water attracted to
soybean roots. Zoospores can attach to roots, germinate and infect the
plant tissues. Diseased roots develop lesions that may spread up the
stem and eventually kill the entire plant. *Phytophthora sojae* also
produces oospores that can remain dormant in the soil over the winter,
or longer, and germinate when conditions are favourable. Oospores may
also be spread by animals or machinery.
