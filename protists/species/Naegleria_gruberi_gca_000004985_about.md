About *Naegleria gruberi str. NEG-M* 
------------------------------------



***Naegleria gruberi*** is a species of *Naegleria*. It is famous for
its ability to change from an amoeba, which lacks a cytoplasmic
microtubule cytoskeleton, to a flagellate, which has an elaborate
microtubule cytoskeleton, including flagella. This \"transformation\"
includes *de novo* synthesis of basal bodies (or centrioles).
