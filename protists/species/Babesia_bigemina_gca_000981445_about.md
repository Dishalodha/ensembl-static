About *Babesia bigemina str. Bond* 
----------------------------------



***Babesia bigemina*** is a species of alveolates belonging to the
phylum Apicomplexa and the family Babesiidae. In cattle, it causes
babesiosis, also called \"Texas fever\". Its length is 4-5 µm and width
is 2-3 µm. Usually, it has an oval shape. In blood cells, it is located
midsagittally and its size gets up to two-thirds of blood cell size.
Babesia bigemina is a type of protozoan parasites and they are
transmitted by Boophilus ticks which are prevalent in tropics. The
genome for B. bigemina is incomplete and unassembled, thus needing
further research.
