About the *Leishmania major* genome
-----------------------------------

Leishmania is a Tryanosomatid protozoa and is the parasite responsible
for the disease Leishmaniasia. Leishmania is transmitted by the bite of
certain species of sand fly and affects the populations of 88 tropical
and sub-tropical countries worldwide. The symptoms are cutaneous and
muco-cutaneous lesions initially around the bite, the parasite can also
migrate causing visceral leishmaniasis affecting the haemopoietic
organs. The current genome corresponds to the Friedlin strain.
