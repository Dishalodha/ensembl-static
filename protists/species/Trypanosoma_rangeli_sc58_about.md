***Trypanosoma rangeli*** is a hemoflagellate protozoan parasite species
of the genus Trypanosoma. Although infecting a variety of mammalian
species in a wide geographical area in Central an South America, this
parasite is considered as non-pathogenic to these hosts. ***T.
rangeli*** is transmitted by bite of infected triatomine bugs of the
Reduviidae family, commonly known as barbeiro, *winchuka* *(vinchuca)*,
chinche, pito ou chup√£o.

The genome has just been published.

Occurring in sympatry with ***Trypanosoma cruzi*** , the etiological
agent of Chagas disease, in wide geographical areas in the Americas,
***T. rangeli*** shares hosts, vectors and a large amount of its
antigenic coat ***T. cruzi*** leading to misdiagnosis of Chagas disease.
