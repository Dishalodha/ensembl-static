About *Plasmodium malariae* 
---------------------------



***Plasmodium malariae*** is a parasitic protozoa that causes malaria in
humans. It is one of several species of *Plasmodium* parasites that
infect humans including *Plasmodium falciparum* and *Plasmodium vivax*
which are responsible for most malarial infection. While found
worldwide, it is a so-called \"benign malaria\" and is not nearly as
dangerous as that produced by *P. falciparum* or *P. vivax*. It causes
fevers that recur at approximately three-day intervals (a *quartan
fever*), longer than the two-day (tertian) intervals of the other
malarial parasites, hence its alternative names **quartan fever** and
**quartan malaria**.
