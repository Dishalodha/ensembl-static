About *Emiliania huxleyi*
-------------------------

*Emiliania huxleyi* is a unicellular, eukaryotic phytoplankton belonging
to the class Coccolithophores of the phylum Haptophyta. *E. huxleyi*
cells are covered with uniquely ornamented calcite (calcium carbonate)
disks called coccoliths. They are the third most abundant group of
phytoplankton, and during massive blooms they can cover over 100,000
square kilometers and are visible from space.

*E. huxleyi* plays a key role in biogeochemical cycle because of its
ability to fix inorganic carbon into both photosynthetic and
biomineralized product, resulting in exporting large amounts of carbon
to deep water sediments. In addition to playing an important role in
global carbon cycling, *E. huxleyi* also contributes to global sulfur
cycling. During grazing *E. huxleyi* produces the climatically active
trace gas dimethyl sulfide, emissions of which may contribute to marine
cloud formation and climate regulation.
