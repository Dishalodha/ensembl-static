About *Plasmodium vivax Brazil I*
---------------------------------



***Plasmodium vivax*** is a protozoal parasite and a human pathogen. The
most frequent and widely distributed cause of recurring (Benign tertian)
malaria, *P. vivax* is one of the five species of malaria parasites that
commonly infect humans. It is less virulent than *Plasmodium
falciparum*, the deadliest of the five, but vivax malaria can lead to
severe disease and death due to splenomegaly (a pathologically enlarged
spleen). *P. vivax* is carried by the female *Anopheles* mosquito, since
it is only the female of the species that bite.
