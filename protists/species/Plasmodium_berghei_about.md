*Plasmodium berghei* is one of four malarial parasites that infect
rodents. *P. berghei* infects murine rodents from Central Africa, and
are also infectious to laboratory rodents and easily maintained by
*Anopheles stephensi* in the laboratory. It serves as a good model for
the human parasites with which it shares many similarities in essential
aspects of structure, biochemistry and life cycle.
