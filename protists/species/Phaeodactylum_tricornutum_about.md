About the *Phaeodactylum tricornutum* genome
--------------------------------------------

*Phaeodactylum tricornutum* is a cosmopolitan marine pennate diatom,
unicellular brown algae that likely arose from the endocytobiosis of a
red alga into a single-celled heterotroph. *P. tricornutum* cells can
undergo morphological transitions between three possible morphotypes,
change in the cell shape stimulated by environmental conditions.
