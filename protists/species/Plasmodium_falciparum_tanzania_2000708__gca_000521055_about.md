About *Plasmodium falciparum Tanzania (2000708)* 
------------------------------------------------



***Plasmodium falciparum*** is a unicellular protozoan parasite of
humans, and the deadliest species of *Plasmodium* that cause malaria in
humans. Almost every malarial death is caused by *P. falciparum*, and
93% of death occurs in Africa. Children under five years of age are most
affected, accounting for 61% of the total deaths. In Sub-Saharan Africa,
over 75% of cases were due to *P. falciparum*, whereas in most other
malarial countries, other, less virulent plasmodial species predominate.
