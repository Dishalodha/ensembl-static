About *Trichomonas vaginalis G3* 
--------------------------------



***Trichomonas vaginalis*** is an anaerobic, flagellated protozoan
parasite and the causative agent of trichomoniasis. It is the most
common pathogenic protozoan infection of humans in industrialized
countries. Infection rates between men and women are similar with women
being symptomatic, while infections in men are usually asymptomatic.
Transmission usually occurs via direct, skin-to-skin contact with an
infected individual, most often through vaginal intercourse. The WHO has
estimated that 160 million cases of infection are acquired annually
worldwide. The estimates for North America alone are between 5 and 8
million new infections each year, with an estimated rate of asymptomatic
cases as high as 50%. Usually treatment consists of metronidazole and
tinidazole.
