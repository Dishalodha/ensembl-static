The genome of *Paramecium tetraurelia* strain d4-2 was sequenced by
[Genoscope](http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/) in collaboration with the
French National Research Organization and the French National DNA
Sequencing Centre. The assembly was imported from the sequence submitted
to the [European Nucleotide Archive](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) (assembly
[GCA\_000165425](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000165425)). The
72-Mb draft assembly of the macronuclei is presented here.
