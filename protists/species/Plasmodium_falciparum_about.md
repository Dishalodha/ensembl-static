### About the *Plasmodium falciparum* genome

*Plasmodium falciparum* is the malarial parasite most dangerous to
humans, accounting for over 90% of all malarial deaths, and was the
first species of the genus *Plasmodium* to be sequenced. Its genome is
notable for an exceptionally low GC content of under 20%. In other
respects, the genome has a similar size (23.3 Mb) and gene count (about
5300) to other species of malaria.
