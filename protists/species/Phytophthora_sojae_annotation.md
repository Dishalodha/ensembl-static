Annotation
----------

The protein coding genes in this site were imported from
[JGI](http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Physo1_1/Physo1_1.home.html). Non coding
RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M. and Eddy,
S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer (Lagesen
K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been applied.
