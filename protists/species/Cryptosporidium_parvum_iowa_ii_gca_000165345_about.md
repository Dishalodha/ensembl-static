***Cryptosporidium parvum*** is one of several species that cause
cryptosporidiosis, a parasitic disease of the mammalian intestinal
tract.

Primary symptoms of *C. parvum* infection are acute, watery, and
nonbloody diarrhea. *C. parvum* infection is of particular concern in
immunocompromised patients, where diarrhea can reach 10--15 l per day.
Other symptoms may include anorexia, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal
pain. Extra-intestinal sites include the lung, liver, and gall bladder,
where it causes respiratory cryptosporidosis, hepatitis, and
cholecystitis, respectively.

Infection is caused by ingestion of sporulated oocysts transmitted by
the faecal-oral route. In healthy human hosts, the median infective dose
is 132 oocysts. The general *C. parvum* lifecycle is shared by other
members of the genus. Invasion of the apical tip of ileal enterocytes by
sporozoites and merozoites causes pathology seen in the disease.

Infection is generally self-limiting in immunocompetent people. In
immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS or those undergoing
immunosuppressive therapy, infection may not be self-limiting, leading
to dehydration and, in severe cases, death.
