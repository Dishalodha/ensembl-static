About *Capsaspora owczarzaki ATCC 30864* 
----------------------------------------



***Capsaspora*** is a monotypic genus containing the single species
***Capsaspora owczarzaki.*** C. owczarzaki is a single-celled eukaryote
that occupies a key phylogenetic position in our understanding of the
origin of animal multicellularity, as one of the closest unicellular
relatives to animals. It is, together with *Ministeria vibrans*, a
member of the Filasterea clade (see "Taxonomy" below). This amoeboid
protist has been pivotal to unravel the nature of the unicellular
ancestor of animals, which has been proved to be much more complex than
previously thought.
