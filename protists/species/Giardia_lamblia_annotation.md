### Annotation

The protein coding gene annotation of the *Giardia lamblia* genome was
imported from European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) accession
[GCA\_000002435](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000002435). *G.
lamblia* genome project are managed by the Marine Biology Laboratories
in Woods Hole and involves collaboration from University of Texas at El
Paso, University of Arizona at Tucson, and University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign.

Non-coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
