About *Salpingoeca rosetta str. ATCC 50818* 
-------------------------------------------



***Salpingoeca rosetta*** is a species of Similar low level Unlike *S.
rosetta*, sponges also have other cell-types that can perform different
functions. Also, the collar cells of sponges beat within canals in the
sponge body, whereas Salpingoeca rosetta's collar cells reside on the
inside and it lacks internal canals. Despite these minor differences,
there is strong evidence that Proterospongia and Metazoa are highly
related.

Its genome has been studied as a model for Premetazoan evolution. The
genome is 55 megabases in size. Homologs of cell adhesion, neuropeptide
and glycosphingolipid metabolism genes are present in the genome.
