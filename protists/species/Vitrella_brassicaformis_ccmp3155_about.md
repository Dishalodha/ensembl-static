***Vitrella brassicaformis***, also known as a \'chromerid\', is a
species of protist isolated from the Great Barrier Reef. Its closest
known relative is *Chromera velia*. *Vitrella* differs from *Chromera*
in having a more complex lifecycle, for instance involving a range of
sizes and morphologies. Also, while *Vitrella* is greenish coloured,
*Chromera* is brown coloured. The differences are in the types of
secondary pigments that characterize each genus. Both genera lack
chlorophyll *b* or *c*; these absences link the two taxonomically, as
algae bearing only chlorophyll *a* are quite few amid the biodiversity
of life. Phylogenetically, both *Vitrella* and *Chromera* are relatives
of the obligately parasitic phylum Apicomplexa, which includes
*Plasmodium*, the agent of malaria. Both *Vitrella brassicaformis* and
*Chromera velia* are photosynthetic.;
