About *Dictyostelium discoideum AX4* 
------------------------------------



***Dictyostelium discoideum*** is a species of soil-living amoeba
belonging to the phylum Mycetozoa. Commonly referred to as slime mold,
*D. discoideum* is a eukaryote that transitions from a collection of
unicellular amoebae into a multicellular slug and then into a fruiting
body within its lifetime. Its unique asexual lifecycle consists of four
stages: vegetative, aggregation, migration, and culmination. The
lifecycle of *D. discoideum* is relatively short, which allows for
timely viewing of all stages. The cells involved in the lifecycle
undergo movement, chemical signaling, and development, which are
applicable to human cancer research. The simplicity of its lifecycle
makes *D. discoideum* a valuable model organism to study genetic,
cellular, and biochemical processes in other organisms.
