***Plasmopara halstedii*** is a plant pathogen infecting sunflowers. The
species is one of many pathogens commonly referred to as downy mildew.
*P. halstedii* originated in North America.

*P. halstedii* oospores produce a thin wall which are resistant
structures, sexually produced that are essential for its continuation.
After entering an area, the eradication of the pathogen is difficult due
to the formation of oospores, which can remain viable in soil for many
years.
