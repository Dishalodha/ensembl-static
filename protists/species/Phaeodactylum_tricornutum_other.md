Other Data
----------

*P. tricornutum* ESTs were sequenced from 16 different cDNA libraries.
These libraries were constructed from cells cultured under different
conditions in order to investigate the molecular basis for responses to
various nutrient and stress conditions and changes in cell morphotype.
These ESTs were aligned to the genome using exonerate.
