To produce the genome sequence, we used an axenic offspring of two F1
siblings obtained by crossing two wild type strains isolated in the Gulf
of Naples (Italy). The genome was assembled from a total of 172 million
101 bp overlapping paired end reads with ~175 bp inserts, 117 million
100 bp paired end reads with ~450 bp inserts, 72 million ~68 bp (after
trimming) mate pair reads with ~1.2 KBp inserts and 5.4 million ~156
bp (after trimming) mate pair reads with ~4.5 Kbp inserts. The final
size of the assembled Psuedo-nitzschia multistriata genome is 59.3 Mbp
including ambiguous bases.
