About *Tritrichomonas foetus str. K* 
------------------------------------



***Tritrichomonas foetus*** is a species of single-celled flagellated
parasites that is known to be a pathogen of the bovine reproductive
tract as well as the intestinal tract of cats. In cattle, the organism
is transmitted to the female vagina and uterus from the foreskin of the
bull where the parasite is known to reside. It causes infertility, and,
at times, has caused spontaneous abortions in the first trimester. In
the last ten years, there have been reports of *Tritrichomonas foetus*
in the feces of young cats that have diarrhea and live in households
with multiple cats. *Tritrichomonas foetus* looks similarly to *Giardia*
and is often misdiagnosis for it when viewed under a microscope.
