***Cryptosporidium parvum*** is one of several protozoal species that
cause cryptosporidiosis, a parasitic disease of the mammalian intestinal
tract.

Primary symptoms of *C. parvum* infection are acute, watery, and
non-bloody diarrhea. *C. parvum* infection is of particular concern in
immunocompromised patients, where diarrhea can reach 10--15L per day.
Other symptoms may include anorexia, nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain.
Extra-intestinal sites include the lung, liver and gall bladder where it
causes respiratory cryptosporidosis, hepatitis and
cholecystitis.\'\><http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/Cryptosporidiosis.htm>\>;

Infection is caused by ingestion of sporulated oocysts transmitted by
the faecal-oral route. In healthy human hosts, the median infective dose
is 132 oocysts. The general *C. parvum* life cycle is shared by other
members of the genus. Invasion of the apical tip of ileal enterocytes by
sporozoites and merozoites causes pathology seen in the disease.

Infection is generally self-limiting in immunocompetent people. In
immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS or those undergoing
immunosuppressive therapy, infection may not be self-limiting, leading
to dehydration and, in severe cases, death.
