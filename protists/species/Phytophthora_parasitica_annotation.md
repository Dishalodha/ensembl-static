Protein coding gene annotation was imported by that provided by the [Phytophthora
parasitica Assembly Dev initiative, Broad
Institute](https://olive.broadinstitute.org/projects/phytophthora_parasitica).

Non coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
