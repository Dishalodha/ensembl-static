Assembly
--------

*T. brucei* nuclear genome and the mitochondrial (kinetoplast) together
have an estimated size of 35Mb/haploid genome. The *T. brucei* genome
contains a ~0.5Mb segmental duplication affecting chromosomes 4 and 8,
which is responsible for some 75 gene duplicates unique to this species.
The assembly is also available from the EMBL/Genbank/DDBJ databases
under the accession
[GCA_000209005.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000209005.1).
