Assembly
--------

The *L. major* (Friedlin strain) genome is 32.8Mb in size, with a
karyotype of 36 chromosomes. The Pathogen Genomics group at the Wellcome
Trust Sanger Institute played a major role by sequencing 24 of the
chromosomes. The others were sequenced by SBRI (Seattle, USA) and
EULEISH consortium. For further details about the sequencing of *L.
major* see *Ivens et al
(2005)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/16020728)*
[[1]](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/16020728). Details of the
centres involved and which chromosomes they sequenced, are given
[here](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/L_major/who&where.shtml). The
sequence data were obtained by several parallel approaches, including
complete cosmid sequencing, whole chromosome shotguns and/or BAC
sequencing/skimming. The assembly is available from the
EMBL/Genbank/DDBJ databases under the accession
[GCA_000002725.2](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000372725.1)
