***Trypanosoma cruzi*** is a species of parasitic euglenoids. Amongst
the protozoa, the trypanosomes characteristically bore tissue in another
organism and feed on blood (primarily) and also lymph. This behaviour
causes disease or the likelihood of disease that varies with the
organism: for example, trypanosomiasis in humans (Chagas disease in
South America), dourine and surra in horses, and a brucellosis-like
disease in cattle. Parasites need a host body and the haematophagous
insect triatomine (descriptions \"assassin bug\", \"cone-nose bug\", and
\"kissing bug\") is the major vector in accord with a mechanism of
infection. The triatomine likes the nests of vertebrate animals for
shelter, where it bites and sucks blood for food. Individual triatomines
infected with protozoa from other contact with animals transmit
trypanosomes when the triatomine deposits its faeces on the host\'s skin
surface and then bites. Penetration of the infected faeces is further
facilitated by the scratching of the bite area by the human or animal
host.
