Annotation
----------

Annotation for the *Plasmodium\_vivax* genomes has been derived from
annotation submitted to the EMBL/Genbank/DDBJ databases; and enhanced by
importing data from additional sources, principally UniProtKB and GOA.
Non coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997) , RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
