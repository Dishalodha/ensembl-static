Protein coding gene annotation was done by the University of Exeter and
Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture (SASA) and the data was
provided by [[Exeter Centre for Emerging Plant
Disease](http://www.excepd.org/).]{style="line-height: 1.5em;"}[

[Non coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.]{style="line-height: 1.5em;" mce-mark="1"}
