About *Phytophthora megakarya str. zdho120*
-------------------------------------------



***Phytophthora megakarya*** is an oomycete plant pathogen that causes
black pod disease in cocoa trees in west and central Africa. This
pathogen can cause detrimental loss of yield in the economically
important cocoa industry, worth approximately \$70 billion annually. It
can damage any part of the tree, causing total yield losses which can
easily reach 20-25%. A mixture of chemical and cultural controls, as
well as choosing resistant plant varieties, are often necessary to
control this pathogen.
