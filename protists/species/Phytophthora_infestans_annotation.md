----------

The protein coding genes in this site are a direct import from [Broad
Institute](http://www.broadinstitute.org/) and MIT under the
*\"Phytophthora infestans Sequencing Project\"*. The data was imported
in December 2010. Non coding RNA genes have been annotated using
tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M. and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et
al 2005), and RNAmmer (Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools
have also been applied.
