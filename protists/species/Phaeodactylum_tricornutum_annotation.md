Annotation
----------

The Phaeodactylum tricornutum genome is a reannotation with 12,089 gene
models predicted by usnig existing gene models, expression data and
protein sequences from related species used to train the SNAP and
Augustus gene prediction programs using the MAKER2 annotation pipeline.
The inputs were:

-   10,402 gene models from a previous genebuild from
    [JGI](http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Phatr2/Phatr2.home.html)
-   13,828 non-redundant ESTs
-   42 libraries of RNA-Seq generated using Illumina technology
-   49 libraries of RNA-Seq data generated under various iron conditions
    using SoLiD technology
-   93,206 Bacillariophyta ESTs from dbEST, 22,502 Bacillariophyta and
    118,041 Stramenopiles protein sequences from UniProt.

Non coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007).
