About *Hammondia hammondi str. H.H.34* 
--------------------------------------



***Hammondia hammondi*** is a species of obligate heteroxenous parasitic
alveolates of domestic cats (final host). Intracellular cysts develop
mainly in striated muscle. After the ingestion of cysts by cats, a
multiplicative cycle precedes the development of gametocytes in the
epithelium of the small intestine (each oocyst of the species averaging
11×13 μm). Oocyst shedding persists for 10 to 28 days followed by
immunity. Cysts in skeletal muscle measure between 100 and 340 μm in
length and 40 and 95 μm in width. Some of the intermediate hosts (e.g.
guinea pigs, hamsters) develop low levels of antibody and some
cross-immunity against *Toxoplasma*.
