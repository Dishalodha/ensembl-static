About the *Pythium aphanidermatum* Genome
-----------------------------------------

*Pythium aphanidermatum* is a plant pathogen causing damping off, root
and stem rots, and blights of grasses and fruits. *P. aphanidermatum*
have wide rage of hosts, including the economically important crops like
beets, pepper and cotton. It is a major cause of root rot in papaya. It
requires warmer temperatures, it is often seen in greenhouses. *P.
aphanidermatum* is responsible for pre and post emergence damping off.
Pre-emergence damping off is when the seed is infected prior to
germination. This can result in poor or no germination, and is
observable as a browning or rotting of the seed. Post emergence damping
off takes place after germination and results in a thinning,
water-soaked stem near the plant collar, which eventually causes the
collapse of the plant.

It belongs to the group oomycetes which was originally classified among
the fungi, due to its morphological and functional similarities. They
are now classifed as protists based on modern insights on phylogentic
relationship with photosynthetic organisms such as brown algae and
diatoms.
