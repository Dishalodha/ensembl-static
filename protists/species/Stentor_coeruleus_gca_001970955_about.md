***Stentor coeruleus*** is a protist in the family Stentoridae which is
characterized by being a very large ciliate that measures 0.5 to 2
millimetres when fully extended.

*Stentor coeruleus* specifically appears as a very large trumpet. It
contains a macronucleus that looks like a string of beads that are
contained within a ciliate that is blue to blue-green in color. Being
that it has many myonemes, it has the ability to contract into a ball.
It has the ability to swim while both fully extended or contracted.

Eating is accomplished using cilia that carry food into the ciliate\'s
gullet.
