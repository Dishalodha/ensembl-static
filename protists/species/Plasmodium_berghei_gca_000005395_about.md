About *Plasmodium berghei (GCA\_000005395)* 
-------------------------------------------



***Plasmodium berghei*** is a protozoan parasite that causes malaria in
certain rodents. Originally, isolated from thicket rats in Central
Africa, *P. berghei* is one of four *Plasmodium* species that have been
described in African murine rodents, the others being *Plasmodium
chabaudi*, *Plasmodium vinckei*, and *Plasmodium yoelii*. Due to its
ability to infect rodents and relative ease of genetic engineering, *P.
berghei* is a popular model organism for the study of human malaria.
