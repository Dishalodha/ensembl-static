About the *Pythium irregulare* Genome
-------------------------------------

*Pythium irregulare* is highly pathogenic to a wide range of cereal and
legume hosts, causing significant loss in yield and vigor.It is a
soilborne pathogen found world wide on \~200 hosts. Like most members of
the *Pythium* species, it causes damping off (i.e. blight) and root rot
of plants located in both greenhouses and the field especially under
moist conditions that favor the spread of this pathogen through
zoospores. While P. irregulare can be isolated by itself from a host, it
is often found in conjunction with another *Pythium* species.

It belongs to the group oomycetes which was originally classified among
the fungi, due to its morphological and functional similarities. They
are now classifed as protists based on modern insights on phylogentic
relationship with photosynthetic organisms such as brown algae and
diatoms.
