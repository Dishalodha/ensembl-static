Annotation
----------

Annotation for the *Emiliania huxleyi* genome has been derived from
annotation submitted to the EMBL/Genbank/DDBJ databases (as the WGS
project
[AHAL00000000](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/AHAL00000000)); and
enhanced by importing data from additional sources, principally
UniProtKB and GOA. Non-coding RNA genes have been annotated using
tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M. and Eddy, S.R. 1997) , RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et
al 2005), and RNAmmer (Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools
have also been applied.
