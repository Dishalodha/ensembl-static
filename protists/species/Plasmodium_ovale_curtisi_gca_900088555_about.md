About *Plasmodium ovale curtisi* 
--------------------------------



***Plasmodium ovale*** is a species of parasitic protozoa that causes
tertian malaria in humans. It is one of several species of *Plasmodium*
parasites that infect humans including *Plasmodium falciparum* and
*Plasmodium vivax* which are responsible for most malarial infection. It
is rare compared to these two parasites, and substantially less
dangerous than *P. falciparum*.

***P.Â ovale*** has recently been shown by genetic methods to consist of
two subspecies, *P. ovale curtisi* and *P. ovale wallikeri*.
