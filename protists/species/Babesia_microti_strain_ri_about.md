About *Babesia microti strain RI* 
---------------------------------



**Theileria microti** is a parasitic blood-borne piroplasm transmitted
by deer ticks. It was previously in the taxonomic genus *Babesia*, as
*Babesia microti*, until ribosomal RNA comparisons placed it in the
sister genus *Theileria*. *T. microti* is responsible for the disease
human theileriosis, similar to babesiosis, a malaria-like disease which
also causes fever and hemolysis.

Within the medical community, as of 2012, this parasitic agent is still
classified as *Babesia microti*.
