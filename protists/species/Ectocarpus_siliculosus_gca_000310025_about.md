About *Ectocarpus siliculosus str. Ec 32 (CCAP 1310/04)* 
--------------------------------------------------------



***Ectocarpus siliculosus*** is a filamentous brown alga
(Heterokontophyta). Its genome was the first brown macroalgal genome to
be sequenced, with the expectation that *E. siliculosus* will serve as a
genetic and genomic model for brown macroalgae.

The alga is unbranched and filamentous; it forms soft beards on larger
plants or other firm substrata and grows up to 2 feet long.

Plants tufted, often only one to a few cm tall, but in exceptional cases
up to 20 cm. Axes freely branched, main axis not distinguishable.
Filaments up to 30μm in diameter, tapering toward the apices. sometimes
forming terminal pseudohairs. Distribution: Cosmopolitan.

This species of ectocarpus has been shown to bind iron on its cells with
non-specificity. This iron ion shell allows the algae to store and have
a constant source of iron regardless of the conditions of the
surrounding environment. This adaptation is important because this
method of iron uptake is similar to that of terrestrial organisms and
differs from the methods typically used in the marine environment such
as siderophores.
