## Ensembl Protists

Ensembl Protists is a browser for protist genomes. A majority of these are taken from the databases of the [International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration](http://www.insdc.org/) (the European Nucleotide Archive at the EBI, GenBank at the NCBI, and the DNA Database of Japan); in some cases, the annotation has been taken directly from the websites of the data generators. Data can be visualised through the Ensembl genome browser and accessed programmatically via our Perl and RESTful APIs. Data is also accessible through public MySQL databases and our FTP site containing full data dumps in FASTA, EMBL, GTF, GFF3, JSON and RDF formats.
