***Torulaspora delbrueckii*** is a ubiquitous yeast species with both
wild and anthropic habitats. The type strain of *T. delbrueckii* is CBS
1146^T^, equivalent to CLIB 230 or ATCC 10662, etc.. The type strain of
*T. delbrueckii* CBS 1146 ^T^ was recently sequenced, and is composed of
8 chromosomes in addition to a mitochondrial genome. *T. delbrueckii*
was formerly known as *Saccharomyces delbrueckii* or *Saccharomyces
rosei* or *Saccharomyces roseus*, and the anamorph is called *Candida
colliculosa* (for a complete list of synonyms, see CBS\'s website). *T.
delbrueckii* is the most studied species of the genus *Torulaspora* that
comprises 8 species to date, including *T. franciscae*, *T.
pretoriensis*, *T. microellipsoides*, *T. globosa*, *T. indica*, *T.
maleeae*, and *T. quercuum*. The taxonomy of the genus *Torulaspora* is
evolving rapidly, and the availability of molecular tools to
discriminate *Torulaspora* species will help correcting errors in
species assignments.
