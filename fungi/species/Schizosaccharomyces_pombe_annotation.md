### Annotation

The fission yeast genome was published in 2002; Genome size is \~14.1Mb
and there are \~5000 annotated protein coding genes and \~1600 annotated
RNA genes. The canonical sequence and annotation of the fission yeast
genome is maintained by [PomBase.org](http://www.pombase.org/). The
genome sequence was released in 2007, but excludes the tandem DNA
repeats on chromosome 3, and 4 gaps remain in the centromeres and
telomeres which are represented by 100Ns.

The annotations are as of release v57 of PomBase from February 2016
