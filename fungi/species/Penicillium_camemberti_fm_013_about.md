***Penicillium camemberti*** is a species of fungus in the family
Trichocomaceae. It is used in the production of Camembert, Brie,
Coulommiers and Cambozola cheeses, on which colonies of *P. camemberti*
form a hard, white crust. It is responsible for giving these cheeses
their distinctive taste. An allergy to the antibiotic penicillin does
not necessarily imply an allergy to cheeses made using *P. camemberti*.

When making soft cheese that involves *Penicillium camemberti*, the mold
may be mixed into the ingredients before being placed in the molds, or
it may be added to the outside of the cheese after it is removed from
the cheese molds. *P. camemberti* is responsible for the soft, buttery
texture of Brie and Camembert, but a too high concentration may lead to
an undesirable bitter taste.

Using PCR techniques, cheese manufacturers can control cheese making by
monitoring the mycelial growth of *P. camemberti*. This is particularly
significant, as controlling the growth is important to maintain
desirable levels of compounds for flavor and to keep toxicity at a safe
level.
