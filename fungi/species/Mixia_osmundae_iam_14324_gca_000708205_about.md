-------------------------------------------------



The **Mixiomycetes** are class of fungi in the Pucciniomycotina
subdivision of the Basidiomycota. The class contains a single order, the
**Mixiales**, which in turn contains a single family, the **Mixiaceae**
that circumscribes the monotypic genus ***Mixia***. Only one species has
been described to date, ***Mixia osmundae***; this species was
originally named *Taphrina osmundae* by Japanese mycologist Toji Nishida
in 1911. It is characterized by having multinucleate hyphae, and by
producing multiple spores on sporogenous cells.
