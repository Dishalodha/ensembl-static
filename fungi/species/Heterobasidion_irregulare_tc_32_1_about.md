***Heterobasidion irregulare*** is a tree root rotting pathogenic fungus
that belongs to the genus *Heterobasidion*, which includes important
pathogens of conifers and other woody plants. It has a wide host and
geographic range throughout North America and causes considerable
economic damage in pine plantations in the United States. This fungus is
also a serious worry in eastern Canada. Due to the ecology, disease
type, host range/preference, interfertility group, and genetic
information, *H.Â irregulare* (formerly known as *Heterobasidion annosum*
P ISG) was designated a new species and distinguished from
*Heterobasidion occidentale* (formerly known as *Heterobasidion annosum*
S ISG).
