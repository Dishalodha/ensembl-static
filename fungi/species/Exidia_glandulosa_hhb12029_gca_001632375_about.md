---------------------------------------------------



***Exidia glandulosa*** (common names **black witches\' butter**,
**black jelly roll**, or **warty jelly fungus**) is a jelly fungus in
the family Auriculariaceae. It is a common, wood-rotting species in
Europe, typically growing on dead attached branches of oak. The fruit
bodies are up to wide, shiny, black and blister-like, and grow singly or
in clusters. Its occurrence elsewhere is uncertain because of confusion
with the related species, *Exidia nigricans*.
