***Grosmannia clavigera*** is a species of sac fungus that causes blue
stain in wood. It spreads to lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine,
Douglas-fir, and whitebark pine trees from the body and a special
structure in the heads of mountain pine beetles. The blue stain fungus
has evolved a relationship with mountain pine beetles that allow them to
travel from tree to tree on a special structure in the beetle's heads
and stops the tree from producing resin to pitch out or kill the beetle,
encouraging the pine beetle infestation occurring all along the Rocky
Mountains from Mexico into Canada. The beetles are able to mine and lay
eggs while avoiding the tree's defenses. The 33 Mb genome of this fungus
was sequenced in 2009.
