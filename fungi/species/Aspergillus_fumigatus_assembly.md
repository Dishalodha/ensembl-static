[J. Craig Venter Institute](http://www.venterinstitute.org/) and the
[Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/A_fumigatus/) sequenced the
*Aspergillus fumigatus* strain Af293 genome at 10.5X coverage using whole genome
shotgun (WGS) sequencing. The draft genome was finished, resulting in a
final assembly that contains 19 contigs in eight
chromosomes.
