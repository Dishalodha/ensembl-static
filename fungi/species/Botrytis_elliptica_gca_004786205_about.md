Botrytis elliptica is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen which infects species of
plants in the Lilium genus, causing the disease commonly known as Lily Gray
Mold.  The symptoms of Lily Gray Mold include the appearance of water-soaked
spots on leaves which appear white and increase in darkness with age, ranging
from gray to brown.  These spots may cover the entire leaf, complemented with a
gray webbing, containing the fungal spores.  The leaves will appear wilted and
branches may die back. In addition to leaves, petals, stems, and buds may be
infected, and this gray webbing will eventually cover the plant, feigning the
appearance of gray flowers.  Infected buds often rot.  Lily Gray Mold disease,
if not properly treated, will appear each year with increasing vigor.
