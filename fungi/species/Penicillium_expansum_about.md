About *Penicillium expansum* 
----------------------------



***Penicillium expansum*** is one of the most prevalent post harvest
rots that infects apples.

Although it is a major economical problem in apples, this plant pathogen
can be isolated from a wide host range, including pears, strawberries,
tomatoes, corn, and rice. This mold also produces the carcinogenic
metabolite patulin, a neurotoxin that is harmful in apple juice and
apple products.
