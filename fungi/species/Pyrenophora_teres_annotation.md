### Annotation

The assembly and protein coding gene annotation of the *Pyrenophora
teres f. teres* genome, which was also performed at the Curtin
University in Australia, was imported from the annotation submitted to
EMBL-Bank as the WGS project
[AEEY00000000](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/AEEY00000000).

Non-coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
