***Gloeophyllum trabeum*** is a plant fungal pathogen. It is a common
type of brown rot fungi, which lives mostly anywhere but is prevalent in
coniferous forests. This organism also makes a very good model organism
for laboratory testing of fungal rot; it is very hearty. Research is
currently being done into the humidity ranges in which it functions
best.
