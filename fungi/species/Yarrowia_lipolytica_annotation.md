### Annotation

Gene models have been created using on feature annotation from the
corresponding INSDC records submitted by the [Genolevures
Consortium](http://genolevures.org/yali.html). Non coding RNA genes have
been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M. and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM
(Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer (Lagesen K.,et al 2007);
additional analysis tools have also been applied.
