***Sporothrix schenckii*** is a fungus that can be found worldwide in
the environment. The species is present in soil as well as in and on
living and decomposing plant material such as peat moss. It can infect
humans as well as animals and is the causative agent of sporotrichosis,
commonly known as \"rose handler\'s disease\". The most common route of
infection is the introduction of spores to the body through a cut or
puncture wound in the skin. Infection commonly occurs in otherwise
healthy individuals but is rarely life-threatening and can be treated
with antifungals. In the environment it is found growing as filamentous
hyphae. In host tissue it is found as a yeast. The transition between
the hyphal and yeast forms is temperature dependent making *S.
schenckii* a thermally dimorphic fungus.
