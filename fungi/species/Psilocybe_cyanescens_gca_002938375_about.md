Psilocybe cyanescens (sometimes referred to as wavy caps or as the potent
Psilocybe) is a species of potent psychedelic mushroom.  The main compounds
responsible for its psychedelic effects are psilocybin and psilocin. It belongs
to the family Hymenogastraceae. A formal description of the species was
published by Elsie Wakefield in 1946 in the Transactions of the British
Mycological Society, based on a specimen she had recently collected at Kew
Gardens.
Psilocybe cyanescens can sometimes fruit in colossal quantity; more than 100,000
mushrooms were found growing in a single patch at a racetrack in England.
