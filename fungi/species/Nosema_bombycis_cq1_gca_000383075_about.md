***Nosema*** is a genus of microsporidian parasites. The genus,
circumscribed by Swiss botanist Karl Wilhelm von NÃ¤geli in 1857,
contains 81 species. Most parasitise insects and other arthropods, and
the best-known *Nosema* species parasitise honeybees, where they are
considered a significant disease by beekeepers, often causing a colony
to fail to thrive in the spring as they come out of their overwintering
period. Eight species parasitize digeneans, a group of parasitic
flatworms, and thus are hyperparasites, i.e., parasites of a parasite.
