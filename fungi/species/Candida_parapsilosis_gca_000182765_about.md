***Candida parapsilosis*** is a fungal species of yeast that has become
a significant cause of sepsis and of wound and tissue infections in
immunocompromised people. Unlike *Candida albicans* and *Candida
tropicalis*, *C. parapsilosis* is not an obligate human pathogen, having
been isolated from nonhuman sources such as domestic animals, insects
and soil. *C. parapsilosis* is also a normal human commensal and it is
one of the fungi most frequently isolated from human hands. There are
several risk factors that can contribute to *C. parapsilosis*
colonization. Immunocompromised individuals and surgical patients,
particularly those undergoing surgery of the gastrointestinal tract, are
at high risk for infection with *C. parapsilosis*. There is currently no
consensus on the treatment of invasive candidiasis caused by *C.
parapsilosis*, although the therapeutic approach typically includes the
removal of foreign bodies such as implanted prostheses and the
administration of systemic antifungal therapy. Amphotericin B and
Fluconazole are often used in the treatment of *C. parapsilosis*
infection.
