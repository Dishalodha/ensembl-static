Annotation of *Tuber melanosporum* was imported from the data files
provided by
[Genoscope](http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/spip/Whole-sequence-shotgun,847.html).
Non coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
