***Tilletia caries*** (synonymous with ***Tilletia tritici***) is a
basidiomycete that causes common bunt of wheat. The common names of this
disease are stinking bunt of wheat and stinking smut of wheat. This
pathogen infects wheat, rye, and various other grasses. *Tilletia
caries* is economically and agriculturally important because it reduces
both the wheat yield and grain quality.
