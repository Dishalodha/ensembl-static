### Annotation

Annotation of *Ashbya gossypii* was [imported from the European
Nucleotide Archive](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/Taxon:284811).
Non coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
