Aspergillus fijiensis is a species of fungus in the genus Aspergillus. It
belongs to the group of black Aspergilli which are important industrial
workhorses. It has been isolated from soil in Fiji and from Lactuca sativa in
Indonesia. This species is able to grow at 37 °C, and produces asperparalines
and okaramins.
The genome of A. fijiensis was sequenced and published in 2014 as part of the
Aspergillus whole-genome sequencing project – a project dedicated to performing
whole-genome sequencing of all members of the genus Aspergillus.
