About *Candida albicans (GCA\_000182965.3)* 
--------------------------------------------------------------

***Candida albicans***, a diploid sexual fungus, is the causal agent of opportunistic 
infections in humans, the most common being oral and vaginal infections. Systemic fungal 
infections have emerged as important causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised 
patients (e.g., AIDS, cancer chemotherapy, organ or bone marrow transplantation). In addition, 
hospital-related infections in patients not previously considered at risk (e.g., patients 
on an intensive care unit) have become a cause of major health concern.
