Ascodesmis nigricans is a coprophilous fungus that could be isolated from the
dung of various animals. It was firstly introduced by Philippe Édouard Léon Van
Tieghem, a French botanist, and was the type species of the genus Ascodesmis. It
is an uncommon species but its development of the fruit body has been the
subject of much laboratory study due to the easy nature of its cultivation.
Ascodesmis nigricans is not pathogenic to human, animals or plants. This species
has world-wide distribution.
