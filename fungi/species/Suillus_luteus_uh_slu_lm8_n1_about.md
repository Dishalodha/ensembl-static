About *Suillus luteus UH-Slu-Lm8-n1* 
------------------------------------



***Suillus luteus*** is a basidiomycete fungus, and the type species of
the genus *Suillus*. It is a common fungus indigenous to coniferous
forests of Eurasia and North America, and introduced to southern
Australia and New Zealand. Commonly referred to as **slippery jack** or
**sticky bun** in English-speaking countries, its names refer to the
brown cap, which is characteristically viscid in wet conditions. The
fungus fruits abundantly in autumn, and is harvested for food. The slime
coating, however, may cause indigestion if not removed.
