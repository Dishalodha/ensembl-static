About *Wolfiporia cocos MD-104 SS10 (GCA\_000344635)* 
-----------------------------------------------------



***Wolfiporia extensa*** (Peck) Ginns (*syn.* *Poria cocos* F.A.Wolf) is
a fungus in the family Polyporaceae. It is a wood-decay fungus but has a
subterranean growth habit. It is notable in the development of a large,
long-lasting underground sclerotium that resembles a small coconut. This
sclerotium called \"(Chinese) Tuckahoe\" or fu-ling, is not the same as
the true tuckahoe used as Indian bread by Native Americans, which is the
arrow arum, *Peltandra virginica*, a flowering tuberous plant in the
arum family. *W. extensa* is also used extensively as a medicinal
mushroom in Chinese medicine. Indications for use in the traditional
Chinese medicine include promoting urination, to invigorate the spleen
function (i.e., digestive function), and to calm the mind.

Common names include **hoelen**, poria, **tuckahoe**, China root, **fu
ling** (茯苓, pīnyīn: fúlíng), and matsuhodo.
