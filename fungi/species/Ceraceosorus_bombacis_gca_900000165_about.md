The **Ceraceosorales** are an order of smut fungi in the class
Exobasidiomycetes. It is a monotypic order, consisting of a single
family, the **Ceraceosoraceae**, which in turn contain a single
monotypic genus, ***Ceraceosorus***. ***C. bombacis*** is a fungus that
infects the tree *Bombax ceiba* in India. This economically important
tree is used as an ornamental tree. Ceraceosorales was circumscribed in
2006; the family Ceraceosoraceae was validated in 2009. *C. bombacis*
was originally described as *Dicellomyces bombacis* in 1973, but B.K.
Bakshi transferred it to the newly described *Ceraceosorus* three years
later.
