### Annotation

Protein coding gene annotation was generated by the [Laboratory of
Phytopathology, Wageningen
University](http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/Expertise-Services/Chair-groups/Plant-Sciences/Laboratory-of-Phytopathology.htm).
The genome was annotated using Maker2 software supported by RNA-seq
reads, assembled RNA-seq data that were used as EST evidence, 35
different fungal proteomes and two ab-intio gene predictors (Augustus
and SNAP). The predicted genes were manually curated using WebApollo
software.

The set of non-coding RNA genes available comprises a set of gene models
