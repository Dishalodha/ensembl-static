***Metarhizium anisopliae***, formerly known as *Entomophthora
anisopliae* (basionym), is a fungus that grows naturally in soils
throughout the world and causes disease in various insects by acting as
a parasitoid. Ilya I. Mechnikov named it after the insect species from
which it was originally isolated - the beetle *Anisoplia austriaca*. It
is a mitosporic fungus with asexual reproduction, which was formerly
classified in the form class Hyphomycetes of the phylum Deuteromycota
(also often called Fungi Imperfecti). According to Paul Stamets, it
could be the answer to prevent colony collapse disorder and catastrophic
famine.

Many isolates have long been recognised to be specific, and they were
assigned variety status, but they have now been assigned as new
*Metarhizium* species, such as *M. anisopliae*, *M. majus* and *M.
acridum* (which was *M. anisopliae* var. *acridum* and included the
isolates used for locust control). *Metarhizium taii* was placed in *M.
anisopliae* var. *anisopliae*, but has now been described as a synonym
of *M. guizhouense* (see *Metarhizium*). The commercially important
isolate M.a. 43 (or F52, Met52, etc.), which infects Coleoptera and
other insect orders has now been assigned to *Metarhizium brunneum*.
