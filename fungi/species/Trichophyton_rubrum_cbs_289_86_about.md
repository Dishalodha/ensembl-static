***Trichophyton rubrum*** is a dermatophytic fungus in the phylum
Ascomycota, class Euascomycetes. It is an exclusively clonal,
anthropophilic saprotroph that colonizes the upper layers of dead skin,
and is the most common cause of athlete\'s foot, fungal infection of
nail, jock itch, and ringworm worldwide. *Trichophyton rubrum* was first
described by Malmsten in 1845 and is currently considered to be a
complex of species that comprises multiple, geographically patterned
morphotypes, several of which have been formally described as distinct
taxa, including *T. raubitschekii*, *T. gourvilii*, *T. megninii* and
*T. soudanense*.
