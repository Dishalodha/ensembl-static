***Fusarium oxysporum*** (Schlecht as emended by Snyder and Hansen), an
ascomycete fungus, comprises all the species, varieties and forms
recognized by Wollenweber and Reinking within an infrageneric grouping
called section Elegans. It is part of the Nectriaceae family.

Although their predominant role in native soils may be harmless or even
beneficial plant endophytes or soil saprophytes, many strains within the
*F. oxysporum* complex are pathogenic to plants, especially in
agricultural settings.
