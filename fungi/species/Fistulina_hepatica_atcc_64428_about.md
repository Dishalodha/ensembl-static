***Fistulina hepatica*** (**beefsteak fungus**, also known as
**beefsteak polypore** or **ox tongue**) is an unusual bracket fungus
classified in the Agaricales, that is commonly seen in Britain, but can
be found in North America, Australia, North Africa, and the rest of
Europe. As its name suggests, it looks remarkably similar to a slab of
raw meat. It has been used as a meat substitute in the past, and can
still be found in some French markets. It has a sour, slightly acidic
taste. For eating it must be collected young and it may be tough and
need long cooking.
