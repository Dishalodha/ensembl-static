About *Exophiala dermatitidis NIH/UT8656* 
-----------------------------------------



***Exophiala dermatitidis*** is a thermophilic black yeast, and a member
of the Herpotrichiellaceae. While the species is only found at low
abundance in nature, metabolically active strains are commonly isolated
in saunas, steam baths, and dish washers. *Exophiala dermatitidis* only
rarely causes infection in humans, however cases have been reported
around the world. In East Asia, the species has caused lethal brain
infections in young and otherwise healthy individuals. The fungus has
been known to cause cutaneous and subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis, and as
a lung colonist in people with cystic fibrosis in Europe. In 2002, an
outbreak of systemic *E. dermatitidis* infection occurred in women who
had received contaminated steroid injections at North Carolina
hospitals.
