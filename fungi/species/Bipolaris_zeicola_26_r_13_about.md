***Cochliobolus carbonum*** (anamorph: *Helminthosporium carbonum*) is
one of more than 40 species of filamentous ascomycetes belonging to the
genus *Cochliobolus* (anamorph: *Bipolaris/Curvularia*). This pathogen
has a worldwide distribution, with reports from Australia, Brazil,
Cambodia, Canada, China, Congo, Denmark, Egypt, India, Kenya, New
Zealand, Nigeria, Solomon Islands, and the United States. *Cochliobolus
carbonum* is one of the most aggressive members of this genus infecting
sorghum (*Sorghum* spp. 1), corn (*Zea mays* 2) and apple (*Malus
domestica* 3). while the asexual stage causes *Helminthosporium* corn
leaf spot. *Cochliobolus carbonum* is pathogenic to all organs of the
corn plant including root, stalk, ear, kernel, and sheath. However,
symptoms of infection show distinct manifestations in different plant
parts: whole plant - seedling blight affects the whole plant, leaf
discoloration and mycelial growth, black fungal spores and lesions
appear on inflorescences and glumes, and grain covered with very dark
brown to black mycelium which gives a characteristic charcoal appearance
due to the production of conidia.
