The [National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE),
Japan](http://www.bio.nite.go.jp/dogan/MicroTop?GENOME_ID=ao) and the
[National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology
(AIST), Japan](http://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html), in collaboration
with other members of the *A. oryzae* Genome Analysis Consortium,
sequenced the genome of *Aspergillus oryzae* strain RIB40 at 9X coverage
using whole genome shotgun (WGS) and clone-based sequencing.

This genome consists of a nuclear genome assembly represented by eight
chromosomes (assembled from 24 entries) and three unplaced contigs
(AP007156, AP007160 and AP007177) and a complete mitochondrial genome
(AP007176). The assembly and scaffolds were validated by optical
mapping.
