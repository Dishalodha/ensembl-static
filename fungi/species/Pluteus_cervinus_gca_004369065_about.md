Pluteus cervinus, also known as Pluteus atricapillus and commonly known as the
deer shield or the deer or fawn mushroom, is a mushroom that belongs to the
large genus Pluteus. It is found on rotten logs, roots and tree stumps and is
widely distributed.  It can also grow on sawdust and other wood waste.  Being
very variable in appearance, it has been divided into several varieties or
subspecies, some of which are sometimes considered species in their own right.
It is edible when young, but considered by some to be of poor quality and is not
often collected for the table.
