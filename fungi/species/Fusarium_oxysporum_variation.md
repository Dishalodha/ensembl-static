### Variation Data

*Fusarium oxysporum* exhibits genetic plasticity which makes it a
destructive pathogen across a wide range of crops. We constructed a
variation database comparing 27 different strains of this species.
Sequence read data was downloaded from [ENA Short Read
Archive](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/SRP002087) and mapped
against the *Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici* genome using
Burrows-Wheeler Alignment Tool (Li H.and Durbin R.Bioinformatics 2010)
and variation calling was done using SAMtools (Li H.et.al Bioinfomratics
2009).
