Lasiodiplodia theobromae is a plant pathogen with a very wide host range. It
causes rotting and dieback in most species it infects. It is a common post
harvest fungus disease of citrus known as stem-end rot. It is a cause of bot
canker of grapevine. It also infects Biancaea sappan, a species of flowering
tree also known as Sappanwood.
On rare occasions it has been found to cause fungal keratitis, lesions on nail
and subcutaneous tissue.
It has been implicated in the widespread mortality of baobab (Adansonia
digitata) trees in Southern Africa. A preliminary study found the deaths to have
a complex set of causes requiring detailed research.
