Fusarium sporotrichioides is a fungal plant pathogen, one of various Fusarium
species responsible for damaging crops, in particular causing a condition known
as Fusarium head blight in wheat, consequently being of notable agricultural and
economic importance. The species is ecologically widespread, being found across
tropical and temperate regions, and is a significant producer of mycotoxins,
particularly trichothecenes. Although mainly infecting crops, F.
sporotrichioides-derived mycotoxins can have repercussions for human health in
the case of the ingestion of infected cereals. One such example includes the
outbreak of alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA) in Russia, of which F.
sporotrichioides-infected crop was suspected to be the cause. Although current
studies on F. sporotrichioides are somewhat limited in comparison to other
species in the genus, Fusarium sporotrichioides has found several applications
as a model system for experimentation in molecular biology.
