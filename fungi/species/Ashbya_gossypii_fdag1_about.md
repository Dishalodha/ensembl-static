About *Ashbya gossypii FDAG1* 
-----------------------------



(also known as **Ashbya gossypii**) is a filamentous fungus or mold
closely related to yeast, but growing exclusively in a filamentous way.
It was originally isolated from cotton as a pathogen causing
stigmatomycosis by Ashby and Nowell in 1926. This disease affects the
development of hair cells in cotton bolls and can be transmitted to
citrus fruits, which thereupon dry out and collapse (dry rot disease).
In the first part of the 20th century, and two other fungi causing
stigmatomycosis (, ) made it virtually impossible to grow cotton in
certain regions of the subtropics, causing severe economical losses.
Control of the spore-transmitting insects - cotton stainer () and
(antestia bugs) - permitted full eradication of infections. was
recognized as a natural overproducer of riboflavin (vitamin B~2~), which
protects its spores against ultraviolet light. This made it an
interesting organism for industries, where genetically modified strains
are still used to produce this vitamin.
