About *Sporidiobolus salmonicolor* 
----------------------------------



***Sporoidiobolus salmonicolor*** is a yeast-like fungus in the
Basidiomycota more commonly known by the name of its asexual yeast-like
state, *Sporobolomyces salmonicolor*. It is generally considered a
Biosafety Risk Group 1 fungus; however isolates of *S. salmonicolor*
have been recovered from cerebrospinal fluid, infected skin, a nasal
polyp, lymphadenitis and a case of endophthalmitis. It has also been
reported in AIDS-related infections. The fungus exists predominantly in
the asexual state as a unicellular, haploid yeast yet this species can
sometimes produce a sexual state when conjugation of compatible yeast
cells occurs. The asexual form consists of a characteristic, pink,
ballistosporic yeast. Ballistoconidia are borne from slender extensions
of the cell known as sterigma, and are forcibly ejected into the air
upon maturity. Levels of airborne yeast cells peak during the night and
are abundant in areas of decaying leaves and grains. Three varieties of
*Sporobolomyces salmonicolor* have been described; *S. salmonicolor*
var. *albus*, *S. salmonicolor* var. *fischerii*, and *S. salmonicolor*
var. *salmoneus*.
