***Aureobasidium namibiae***, formerly known as *Aureobasidium
pullulans* var. *namibiae* is a ubiquitous black, yeast-like fungus. It
was described on the basis of only one strain isolated from dolomitic
marble in Namibia (hence its name *namibiae*).

The genome of *A. namibiae* (as well as other closely related species)
contains unusually high numbers of genes for extracellular enzymes for
carbohydrate degradation (CAZy) and proteases, MFS membrane sugar
transporters, and alkali metal cation transporters (or ion
transporters). Genes presumably involved in the synthesis of the
biotechnologically important polysaccharide pullulan and siderophores
were found, but the gene for antibiotic Aureobasidin A could not be
identified. Genes possibly associated with the degradation of plastic
and aromatic compounds are also present.

Due to the relatively recent redefinition of the species, most published
work does not yet distinguish between the new species belonging to the
previously recognised *A. pullulans* species complex. It is therefore
not clear to what extent this knowledge is valid for *A. namibiae*.
