About *Encephalitozoon intestinalis ATCC 50506* 
-----------------------------------------------



***Encephalitozoon intestinalis*** is a parasite. It can cause
microsporidiosis.

It is notable as having one of the smallest genome among known
eukaryotic organisms, containing only 2.25 million base pairs. Its
genome was completely sequenced in 2010.

*E. intestanalis* originally named Septata intestinalis, was
reclassified based on morphologic, antigenic and molecular similarities
with other species of the genus Encephalitozoon. Recently, Some domestic
and wild animals have been found to be naturally infected with *E.
intestanalis* and some other microsporidian species.
