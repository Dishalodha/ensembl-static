***Pseudallescheria boydii*** is a species of fungus classified in the
Ascomycota. and pseudallescheriasis. Typically found in stagnant and
polluted water, it has been implicated in the infection of
immunocompromised and near-drowned pneumonia patients. Its asexual
(anamorphic) form is ***Scedosporium apiospermum***. Treatment of
infections with *P.Â boydii* is complicated by its resistance to many of
the standard antifungal agents normally used to treat infections by
filamentous fungi.

*Pseudallescheria boydii* fungal infection killed three athletes injured
in the 1997 Maccabiah Games when, at the opening ceremony, a bridge
collapsed into the Yarkon River.
