Coprinopsis marcescibilis is a species of agaric fungus in the family
Psathyrellaceae. It was first described in 1893 by German mycologist Max
Britzelmayr; Rolf Singer moved it to Psathyrella in 1951. It was transferred to
Coprinopsis in 2008, when molecular analysis revealed phylogenetic affinity with
that genus. The species is found in Europe and North America.
