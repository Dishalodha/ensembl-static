Aspergillus parasiticus is a fungus belonging to the genus Aspergillus. This
species is an unspecialized saprophytic mold, mostly found outdoors in areas of
rich soil with decaying plant material as well as in dry grain storage
facilities. Often confused with the closely related species, A. flavus, A.
parasiticus has defined morphological and molecular differences. Aspergillus
parasiticus is one of three fungi able to produce the mycotoxin, aflatoxin, one
of the most carcinogenic naturally occurring substances. Environmental stress
can upregulate aflatoxin production by the fungus, which can occur when the
fungus is growing on plants that become damaged due to exposure to poor weather
conditions, during drought, by insects, or by birds.  In humans, exposure to A.
parasiticus toxins can cause delayed development in children and produce serious
liver diseases and/or hepatic carcinoma in adults. The fungus can also cause the
infection known as aspergillosis in humans and other animals. A. parasiticus is
of agricultural importance due to its ability to cause disease in corn, peanut,
and cottonseed.
