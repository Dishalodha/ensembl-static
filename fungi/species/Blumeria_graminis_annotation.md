### Annotation

This annotation of *Blumeria graminis* is the product of a comprehensive
manual review undertaken by the *Blumeria graminis* community, supported
by Ensembl Genomes. Members of the *B. graminis* community were trained
by Ensembl Genomes to use Apollo (a web-based gene editing tool). This
process used dense transcriptomics data as evidence, resulting in 7118
protein coding genes (an increase of 648 genes from the previous
annotation). This curation effort resulted in several improvements to
the gene set including the addition of UTRs to the gene models,
correction of gene boundaries and exons, and the discovery of nearly 650
new genes.

Functional annotation and comparative analyses were conducted on this
revised gene set through the Ensembl Genomes pipelines, and made
available in release 39.
