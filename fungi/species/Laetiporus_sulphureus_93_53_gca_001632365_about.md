***Laetiporus sulphureus*** is a species of bracket fungus (fungi that
grow on trees) found in Europe and North America. Its common names are
**crab-of-the-woods**, **sulphur polypore**, **sulphur shelf**, and
**chicken-of-the-woods**. Its fruit bodies grow as striking
golden-yellow shelf-like structures on tree trunks and branches. Old
fruitbodies fade to pale beige or pale grey. The undersurface of the
fruit body is made up of tubelike pores rather than gills.

*Laetiporus sulphureus* is a saprophyte and occasionally a weak
parasite, causing brown cubical rot in the heartwood of trees on which
it grows. Unlike many bracket fungi, it is edible when young, although
adverse reactions have been reported.
