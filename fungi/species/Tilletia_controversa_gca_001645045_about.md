About *Tilletia controversa str. DAOM 236426 (GCA\_001645045)* 
--------------------------------------------------------------



***Tilletia controversa*** is a plant pathogen. It is a fungus known to
cause the smut disease **TCK smut** in soft white and hard red winter
wheats. It stunts the growth of the plants and leaves smut balls in the
grain heads. When the grain is milled the smut balls emit a fishy odor
that lowers the quality of the flour.

TCK smut exists in the western and northwestern United States, but is
not considered a major problem. The disease took on policy significance
because China applied a zero tolerance on the presence of TCK spores,
resulting in a ban from 1974 to 1999 on shipments from the Pacific
Northwest. Until the summer of 1996, China accepted shipments of U.S.
wheat from the Gulf Coast, and negotiated price discounts with the
shippers to cover the cost of decontamination if traces of TCK were
found. Then in June 1996, China rejected all cargoes of U.S. wheat with
traces of TCK. The November 1999 U.S.-China Agricultural Cooperation
Agreement removes the ban and allows imports of U.S. wheat and other
grains that meet a specific TCK tolerance level, thus improving the
competitiveness of U.S. wheat with Canadian and Australian exports.
