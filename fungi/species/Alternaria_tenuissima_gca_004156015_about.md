Alternaria tenuissima is a saprophytic fungus and opportunistic plant pathogen.
It is cosmopolitan in distribution, and can colonize a wide range of plant
hosts. Colonies of A. tenuissima produce chains on agar growth media. The fungus
often forms concentric ring patterns on infected plant leaves. This species
produces the allergen Alt a 1, one of the most important outdoor seasonal fungal
allergens associated with allergy and asthma provocation. In rare circumstances,
this species is also known to infect immunosuppressed humans and animals.
