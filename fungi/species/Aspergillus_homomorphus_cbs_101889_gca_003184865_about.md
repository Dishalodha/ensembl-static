Aspergillus homomorphus is a species of fungus in the genus Aspergillus. It
belongs to the group of black Aspergilli which are important industrial
workhorses. It has been isolated from soil from the Dead Sea in Israel. The
mycotoxin secalonic acid D has been reported from this fungus. In addition, it
produces many exometabolites only found in this fungus.
The genome of A. homomorphus was sequenced and published in 2014 as part of the
Aspergillus whole-genome sequencing project â€“ a project dedicated to performing
whole-genome sequencing of all members of the genus Aspergillus.
