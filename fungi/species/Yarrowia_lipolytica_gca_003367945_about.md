Yarrowia is a fungal genus in the family Dipodascaceae. For a while the genus
was monotypic, containing the single species Yarrowia lipolytica, a yeast that
can use unusual carbon sources, such as hydrocarbons. This has made it of
interest for use in industrial microbiology, especially for the production of
specialty lipids. Molecular phylogenetics analysis has revealed several other
species that have since been added to the genus.
In January 2019, Yarrowia lipolytica yeast biomass was defined by the European
Food Safety Authority as a safe novel food – dried and heat‐killed –  with the
underlying qualifications that it is widespread in nature, present in the
typical environment, may be used as food for people over age 3 (3 grams per day
for children under age 10, and 6 grams per day for teens and adults), and may be
manufactured as a dietary supplement.
