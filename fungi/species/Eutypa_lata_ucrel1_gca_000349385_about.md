About *Eutypa lata UCREL1 (GCA\_000349385)* 
-------------------------------------------



**Dead arm**, sometimes **grape canker**, is a disease of grapes caused
by a deep-seated wood rot of the arms or trunk of the grapevine. As the
disease progresses over several years, one or more arms may die, hence
the name \"dead arm\". Eventually the whole vine will die. In the 1970s,
dead-arm was identified as really being two diseases, caused by two
different fungi, *Eutypa lata* and *Phomopsis viticola* (syn.
*Cryptosporella viticola*).
