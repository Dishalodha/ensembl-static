[[The ]{style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34)"}[Broad
Institute](http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/pyrenophora_tritici_repentis)[
sequenced the ]{style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34)"}*Pyrenophora
tritici-repentis*[ strain Pt-1C-BFP (Race 1) genome at 6.93X coverage
using whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing. Race 1 is the most
prevalent race found in both the US and throughout the world and most of
the molecular genetics and applied research has been conducted on race 1
isolates. The first host-selective, protein toxin, Ptr ToxA, was
characterized from this race as well. The current assembly (Assembly 1)
consists of 703 nuclear genome contigs in 47 supercontigs, and 2
mitochondrial genome contigs in 1 supercontig. The genome assembly has
been annotated using automated gene prediction
tools.]{style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34)"}]{style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"}
