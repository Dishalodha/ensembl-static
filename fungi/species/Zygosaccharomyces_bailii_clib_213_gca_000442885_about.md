***Zygosaccharomyces bailii*** is a species in the genus
*Zygosaccharomyces*. It was initially described as *Saccharomyces
bailii* by Lindner in 1895, but in 1983 it was reclassified as
*Zygosaccharomyces bailii* in the work by Barnett et al.

Spoilage resulting from growth of the yeast *Zygosaccharomyces* is
widespread, which has caused significant economic losses to the food
industry. Within this genus, *Z. bailii* is one of the most troublesome
species due to its exceptional tolerance to various stressful
conditions. A wide range of acidic and/or high-sugar products such as
fruit concentrates, wine, soft drinks, syrups, ketchup, mayonnaise,
pickles, salad dressing, etc., are normally considered to be
shelf-stable, i.e. they readily inactivate a broad range of food-borne
microorganisms. However, these products are still susceptible to
spoilage by *Z. bailii*.
