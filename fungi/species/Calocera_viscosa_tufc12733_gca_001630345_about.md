***Calocera viscosa***, commonly known as the **yellow stagshorn**, is a
jelly fungus, a member of the Dacrymycetales, an order of fungi
characterized by their unique \"tuning fork\" basidia.

It has bright orange, yellow or occasionally white branching
basidiocarps, which are somewhat gelatinous in texture and slimy to the
touch (hence the specific name). It is relatively large for a jelly
fungus, and can reach up to ten centimetres in height. It is widespread
and common, and its bright colour makes it stand out in its habitat. It
grows on decaying conifer wood, typically stumps and roots, although
this may not be obvious if the wood is covered in leaf litter. It fruits
throughout the year, but is most commonly seen in autumn.

It is not poisonous, but its tough gelatinous texture and nondescript
taste and odour make it unattractive as a food. Its striking colour has
led to it being used as a garnish on occasion, however.
