Saccharomyces pastorianus is a yeast used industrially for the production of
lager beer, and was named in honour of Louis Pasteur by the German Max Reess in
1870. This yeast's  complicated genome appears to be the result of hybridisation
between two pure species in the Saccharomyces species complex, a factor that led
to difficulty in establishing a proper taxonomy of the species.
The now-defunct synonym Saccharomyces carlsbergensis was and continues to be
used in scientific literature, but is invalid, as the name Saccharomyces
pastorianus (Reess 1870) has taxonomic precedence. The name S. carlsbergensis is
typically attributed to Emil Christian Hansen from the era when he worked for
the Danish brewery Carlsberg in 1883, but in actuality it was not officially
described by Hansen as a distinct species until 1908, along with another
synonym, Saccharomyces monacensis. The type strains of both synonyms are
currently stored in yeast banks under the taxonomic name S. pastorianus.
