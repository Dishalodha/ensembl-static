About *Bipolaris sorokiniana ND90Pr (GCA\_000338995)* 
-----------------------------------------------------



The fungus ***Cochliobolus sativus*** is the teleomorph (sexual stage)
of ***Bipolaris sorokiniana*** (anamorph) which is the causal agent of a
wide variety of cereal diseases. The pathogen can infect and cause
disease on the root (where it is known as common root rot), leaf and
stem, and head tissue. *C.sativus* is extremely rare in nature and thus
it is the asexual or anamorphic stage which causes infections. The two
most common diseases caused by *B.sorokiniana* are spot blotch and
common root rot, mainly on wheat and barley crops.
