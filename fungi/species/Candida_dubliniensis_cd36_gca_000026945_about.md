--------------------------------------------------



***Candida dubliniensis*** is a fungal opportunistic pathogen originally
isolated from AIDS patients. It is also occasionally isolated from
immunocompetent individuals. It is a dimorphic yeast of the genus
*Candida*, very closely related to *Candida albicans* but forming a
distinct phylogenetic cluster in DNA fingerprinting. It is most commonly
isolated from oral cavities, and is also occasionally found in other
anatomical sites.
