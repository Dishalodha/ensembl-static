### Annotation

The sequencing, assembly and annotation of protein coding genes from the
Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (CRL 75-36-700-3) genome has been
generated by the [Broad Institute](http://www.broadinstitute.org) as
part of their work on the Puccinia group of fungi
(<http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/puccinia_group/Info.html>).
The genome has been sequenced to a coverage of 12x and was most recently
updated in 2008. It consists of 393 scaffolds with a total size of 84
Mb. The current release includes the most recent gene set from Broad
Institute that consists in 15,800 protein coding genes submitted to
INSDC in 16/12/2011.

Non coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
