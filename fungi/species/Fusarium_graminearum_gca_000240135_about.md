About *Fusarium graminearum PH-1 (GCA\_000240135)* 
--------------------------------------------------



***Gibberella zeae***, also known by the name of its anamorph
***Fusarium graminearum***, is a plant pathogen which causes fusarium
head blight, a devastating disease on wheat and barley. The pathogen is
responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each
year. Infection causes shifts in the amino acid composition of wheat,
resulting in shriveled kernels and contaminating the remaining grain
with mycotoxins, mainly deoxynivalenol, which inhibits protein
biosynthesis; and zearalenone, an estrogenic mycotoxin. These toxins
cause vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in livestock, and
are harmful to humans through contaminated food. Despite great efforts
to find resistance genes against *F. graminearum*, no completely
resistant variety is currently available. Research on the biology of *F.
graminearum* is directed towards gaining insight into more details about
the infection process and reveal weak spots in the life cycle of this
pathogen to develop fungicides that can protect wheat from scab
infection.
