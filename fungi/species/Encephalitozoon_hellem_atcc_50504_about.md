-----------------------------------------



**Microsporidiosis** is an opportunistic intestinal infection that
causes diarrhea and wasting in immunocompromised individuals (HIV, for
example). It results from different species of microsporidia, a group of
microbial (unicellular) fungi.

In HIV infected individuals, microsporidiosis generally occurs when CD4+
T cell counts fall below 150.
