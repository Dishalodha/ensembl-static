Puccinia coronata is a plant pathogen and causal agent of oat and barley crown
rust. The pathogen occurs worldwide, infecting both wild and cultivated oats.
Crown rust poses a threat to barley production, because the first infections in
barley occur early in the season from local inoculum. Crown rusts have evolved
many different physiological races within different species in response to host
resistance. Each pathogenic race can attack a specific line of plants within the
species typical host. For example, there are over 290 races of P. coronata.
