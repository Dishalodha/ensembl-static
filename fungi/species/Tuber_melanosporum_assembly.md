### Assembly

The genome of *Tuber melanosporum* was sequenced and assembled by
[Genoscope](http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/spip/Whole-sequence-shotgun,847.html)
using a whole-genome shotgun strategy (WGS). The draft genome comprises
\~125Mb at 10x coverage, and is the largest and most complex fungal
genome sequenced to date.
