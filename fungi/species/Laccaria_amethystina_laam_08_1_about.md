About *Laccaria amethystina LaAM-08-1* 
--------------------------------------



***Laccaria amethystina***, commonly known as the **amethyst deceiver**,
is a small brightly colored, edible mushroom, that grows in deciduous as
well as coniferous forests. Because its bright amethyst coloration fades
with age and weathering, it becomes difficult to identify, hence the
common name 'Deceiver'. This common name is shared with its close
relation *Laccaria laccata* that also fades and weathers. It is found
mainly in Northern temperate zones, though it is reported to occur in
tropical Central and South America as well. Recently, some of the other
species in the genus have been given the common name of \"deceiver\".
