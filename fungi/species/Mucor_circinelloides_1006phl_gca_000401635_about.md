Mucor circinelloides is a dimorphic fungus belonging to the Order Mucorales
(Phylum Mucoromycota). It has a worldwide distribution, found mostly in soil,
dung and root vegetables. This species is described as not known to be able to
produce mycotoxins, however it has been frequently reported to infect animals
such as cattle and swine, as well as fowl, platypus and occasionally humans.
Ketoacidotic patients are particularly at risk for infection by M.
circinelloides.
