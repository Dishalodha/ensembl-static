About *Coccidioides posadasii str. Silveira* 
--------------------------------------------



***Coccidioides posadasii*** is a pathogenic fungus that, along with
*Coccidioides immitis*, is the causative agent of coccidioidomycosis, or
valley fever in humans. It resides in the soil in certain parts of the
Southwestern United States, northern Mexico, and some other areas in the
Americas, but its evolution was connected to its animal hosts.

*C. posadasii* and *C. immitis* are morphologically identical, but
genetically and epidemiologically distinct. *C. posadasii* was
identified as a separate species other than *C. immitis* in 2002 after a
phylogenetic analysis. The two species can be distinguished by DNA
polymorphisms and different rates of growth in the presence of high salt
concentrations: *C. posadasii* grows more slowly. It is also differs
epidemiologically, since it is found outside the San Joaquin Valley.
Unlike *C. immitis*, which is geographically largely limited to
California, *C. posadasii* can also be found in northern Mexico and
South America.
