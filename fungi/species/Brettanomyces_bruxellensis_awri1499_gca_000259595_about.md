***Brettanomyces bruxellensis*** (the anamorph of *Dekkera
bruxellensis*) is a yeast associated with and named after, the Senne
valley near Brussels, Belgium. It is one of several members of the genus
*Brettanomyces*, which were first classified at the Carlsberg brewery in
1904 by their technical director Niels Hjelte Claussen , who was
investigating it as a cause of the fine flavour and condition of English
ales, hence the name. Claussen applied on 17 May 1904 under U.S. Patent
Application Number: US1904208464A for the \"Manufacture of English beers
and malt liquors\". The patent was granted on 20 February 1906. The
Isolation of an organism derived from bottles of traditional English
beer was described and therefore the name *Brettanomyces* was chosen,
from \"briton\" for the British origin and \"myces\" for the
characterisation as fungus. Despite its Latin species name, *B.
bruxellensis* is found all over the globe. In the wild, it is often
found on the skins of fruit.
