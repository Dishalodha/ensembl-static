About *Tilletia indica str. DAOM 236416 (GCA\_001645015)* 
---------------------------------------------------------



**Karnal bunt** (also known as **partial bunt**) is a fungal disease of
wheat, durum wheat, and triticale. The smut fungus ***Tilletia
indica***, a basidiomycete, invades the kernels and obtains nutrients
from the endosperm, leaving behind waste products with a disagreeable
odor that makes bunted kernels too unpalatable for use in flour or
pasta. While Karnal bunt generally does not lead to devastating crop
losses, it has the potential to dramatically decrease yield and poses
additional economic concerns through quarantines which limit the export
of suspected infectious wheat products from certain areas, including the
U.S. Several chemical control methods exist for Karnal bunt of wheat,
but much work remains to be done in identifying resistant host
varieties.
