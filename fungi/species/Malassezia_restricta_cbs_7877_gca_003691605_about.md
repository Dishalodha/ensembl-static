Malassezia (formerly known as Pityrosporum) is a genus of fungi. Malassezia is
naturally found on the skin surfaces of many animals, including humans. In
occasional opportunistic infections, some species can cause hypopigmentation or
hyperpigmentation on the trunk and other locations in humans. Allergy tests for
this fungus are available.
