Elsinoë australis is a fungal plant pathogen that causes sweet orange scab
(SOS). The disease only attacks the fruit of citrus trees, causing the formation
of pustules and lesions on the skin of the fruit. The spores of the fungus are
spread from tree to tree by rain splash. It can be controlled by the use of
various fungicides including strobulins and thiophanate methyl.
