***Stereum hirsutum***, also called False Turkey Tail, is a fungus
typically forming multiple brackets on dead wood. It is also a plant
pathogen infecting peach trees. *S. hirsutum* is in turn parasitised by
certain other species such as the fungus *Tremella aurantia*. Substrates
for *S.Â hirsutum* include dead limbs and trunks of both hardwoods and
conifers.
