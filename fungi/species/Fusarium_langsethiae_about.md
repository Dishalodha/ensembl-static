About *Fusarium langsethiae* 
----------------------------



***Fusarium langsethiae*** is a species of fungus in the family
Nectriaceae. It is a suspected plant pathogen. This species was isolated
from oats, wheat and barley kernels in several European countries. It
resembles *Fusarium poae*, from which it differs by slower growth, less
aerial mycelium and absence of odour. Its turnip-shaped or spherical
conidia are borne in the aerial mycelium, whereas those of *F.Â poae* are
produced on straight monophialides mostly in the aerial mycelium. It
does not produce sporodochial conidia.
