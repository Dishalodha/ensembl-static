Protein coding gene models were imported from the annotation submitted to INSDC as
[GCA_000350065.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000350065.1).

Non-coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
