About *Beauveria bassiana*
--------------------------

*Beauveria bassiana* str. ARSEF 8028 is a fungus that grows naturally in soils throughout the world and acts as a
parasite on various arthropod species, causing white muscardine disease; it thus
belongs to the [entomopathogenic fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomopathogenic_fungi "Entomopathogenic fungi"). 
It is being used as a biological insecticide to control a number of pests such as termites, thrips,
whiteflies, aphids and various beetles. Its use in the control of bedbugs and malaria-transmitting
mosquitos is under investigation.
