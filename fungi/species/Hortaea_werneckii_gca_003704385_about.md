Hortaea werneckii is a species of yeast in the family Teratosphaeriaceae.
Several salt-tolerance mechanisms of H. werneckii have been studied on molecular
level. For example, it is known that its major compatible solutes are glycerol,
erythritol, arabitol, and mannitol; melanin accumulation of the cell wall aids
in retention of at least glycerol inside of the cell. Several components of the
high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signalling pathway (which controls responses to
osmotic shock) have been studied in detail and some seem to differ in function
compared to their counterparts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Whole genome sequencing of H. werneckii Genes encoding metal cation
transporters, which are thought to play a role in halotolerance, experienced
several additional gene duplications at various points during their evolution.
A homothallic mating locus was found in all sequenced genomes, although one of
the mating genes may have been inactivated in some strains. Despite this,
phylogenetic analyses and linkage disequilibrium analyses indicate that H.
werneckii is asexual.
