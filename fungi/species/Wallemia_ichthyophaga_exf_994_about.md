About *Wallemia ichthyophaga EXF-994* 
-------------------------------------



***Wallemia ichthyophaga*** is one of the three species of the genus
*Wallemia*, which in turn is the only genus of the class
Wallemiomycetes. These increase in size almost four-fold when exposed to
high salinity, and the cell wall experiences a three-fold thickening..
This results in a substantially decreased functional cell volume and is
thought to be one of the halotolerance mechanisms of this species.
