---------------------------------------

*Aspergillus nidulans* (also called *Emericella nidulans* when referring
to its sexual form, or teleomorph) is one of many species of filamentous
fungi in the phylum Ascomycota. It has been an important research
organism for studying eukaryotic cell biology for over 50 years, being
used to study a wide range of subjects including recombination, DNA
repair, mutation, cell cycle control, tubulin, chromatin, nucleokinesis,
pathogenesis, metabolism and experimental evolution.
