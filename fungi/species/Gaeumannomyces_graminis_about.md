About the *Gaeumannomyces graminis* genome
------------------------------------------

The take-all fungus, *Gaeumannomyces graminis* (ascomycota), is a major
root-rot pathogen of cereals and grasses. All varieties of wheat and
barley are susceptible. It is an important disease in winter wheat
particularly, and is favoured by conditions of intensive production and
monoculture. It survives in the soil on infected residues of one crop,
then invades the roots of the following crop, progressively destroying
the root system. In exceptional cases it can kill the whole crop; hence
the name \"take-all\".
