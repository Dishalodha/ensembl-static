***Hypholoma lateritium***, sometimes called **brick cap**, is rarer and
less well-known than its relatives, the inedible, and poisonous sulfur
tuft (*Hypholoma fasciculare*) and the edible *Hypholoma capnoides*. Its
fruiting bodies are generally larger than either of these. *Hypholoma
sublateritium* is a synonym.

In Europe this mushroom is often considered inedible or even poisonous,
but in the USA and Japan it is apparently a popular edible fungus. One
further reason to avoid it is the possibility of confusion with
*Galerina marginata* or *H. fasciculare*.

In Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and West Virginia they are found in dense
clusters on stumps and roots from October until long after frosts.
