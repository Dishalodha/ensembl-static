About *Rhizoctonia solani AG-8 WAC10335 (GCA\_000695385)* 
---------------------------------------------------------



***Rhizoctonia solani*** (teleomorph: ***Thanatephorus cucumeris***) is
a plant pathogenic fungus with a wide host range and worldwide
distribution. It was discovered more than 100 years ago. *R. solani*
frequently exists as thread-like growth on plants or in culture, and is
considered a soil-borne pathogen. *R. solani* is best known to cause
various plant diseases such as collar rot, root rot, damping off, and
wire stem. *R. solani* attacks its hosts when they are in their early
stages of development, such as seeds and seedlings, which are typically
found in the soil. The pathogen is known to cause serious plant losses
by attacking primarily the roots and lower stems of plants. Although it
has a wide range of hosts, its main targets are herbaceous plants. *R.
solani* would be considered a basidiomycete fungus if the teleomorph
stage were more abundant. The pathogen is not currently known to produce
any asexual spores (conidia), though it is considered to have an asexual
lifecycle. Occasionally, sexual spores (basidiospores) are produced on
infected plants. The disease cycle of *R. solani* is important in
management and control of the pathogen.
