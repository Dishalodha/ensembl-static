About *Wallemia sebi CBS 633.66* 
--------------------------------



***Wallemia sebi*** is a brown mold or hyphomycete commonly found in
indoor air dust, soil and dried and salty foods (bread, cakes, sugar,
dried fish, dates, bacon, jams). It is xerophilic, meaning it thrives in
arid environments or substrates with little free water. To isolate this
fungus, media with low water activity need to be used, with solutes such
as glycerol, high sugar content or high salt content. It is present in a
significant proportion of human dwellings.

On agar media with low water activity, *W. sebi* forms slow growing
brown colonies with a fine velvety texture. The conidia (asexual spores)
are produced in long chains derived from a conidiogenous cell on
branches of hyphae, and are often in groups of four. Only the asexual
stage is observed in culture, although analyses of its genome indicate
the presence of mating genes and genes involved in meiosis. Under salty
conditions, *W. sebi* produces secondary metabolites causing hemolysis.
It has been rarely reported to cause subcutaneous infections in humans.
