***Diaporthe helianthi*** is a fungal pathogen that causes ***Phomopsis*
stem canker of sunflowers**. In sunflowers, *Phomopsis helianthi*
(teleomorph =*Diaporthe helianthi*) is the causative agent behind stem
canker. Its primary symptom is the production of large canker lesions on
the stems of sunflower plants. These lesions can eventually lead to
lodging and plant death. This disease has been shown to be particularly
devastating in southern and eastern regions of Europe, although it can
also be found in the United States and Australia. While cultural control
practices are the primary method of controlling for Stem Canker, there
have been a few resistant cultivars developed in regions of Europe where
the disease is most severe.
