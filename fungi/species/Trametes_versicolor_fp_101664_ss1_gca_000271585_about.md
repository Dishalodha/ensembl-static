----------------------------------------------------------



***Trametes versicolor*** -- also known as *Coriolus versicolor* and
*Polyporus versicolor* -- is a common polypore mushroom found throughout
the world. Meaning \'of several colours\', *versicolor* reliably
describes this fungus that displays different colors. For example,
because its shape and multiple colors are similar to those of a wild
turkey, *T. versicolor* is commonly called **turkey tail**.
