***Madurella mycetomatis*** is a fungus primarily reported in Central
Africa as a cause of mycetoma in humans. It has been misclassified for
many years, but with improvement of molecular techniques, its
phylogenetic classification has been established. Many methods exist to
identify *M. mycetomatis,* both in lesions and in culture. Histological
examination is especially useful, as it has many unique morphological
features. Strain-level differences in response to antifungal agents is
informative for treatment and laboratory isolation of cultures.
