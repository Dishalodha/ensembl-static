### Annotation

The genome sequence, assembly and protein coding genes annotation of the
*Magnaporthe poae* (strain ATCC 64411) genome have been generated by the
[Broad Institute](http://www.broadinstitute.org) of MIT and Harvard
under the *Magnaporthe poae* sequencing project.

Non coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
