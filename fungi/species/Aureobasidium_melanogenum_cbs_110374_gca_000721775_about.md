***Aureobasidium melanogenum***, formerly known as ***Aureobasidium
pullulans* var. *melanogenum*** is a ubiquitous black, yeast-like fungus
that is found mainly in freshwater habitats. The species also includes
strains causing human infections, which were previously classified as
*A. pullulans*. It was named due to abundant melanin production and
accumulation in the cell walls, which leads to dark green, brown or
black appearance of the cells and colonies

The genome of *A. melanogenum* (as well as other closely related
species) contains unusually high numbers of genes for extracellular
enzymes for carbohydrate degradation (CAZy) and proteases, MFS membrane
sugar transporters, and alkali metal cation transporters (or ion
transporters). Genes presumably involved in the synthesis of the
biotechnologically important polysaccharide pullulan and siderophores
were found, but the gene for antibiotic Aureobasidin A could not be
identified. Genes possibly associated with the degradation of plastic
and aromatic compounds are also present.

Due to the relatively recent redefinition of the species, most published
work does not yet distinguish between the new species belonging to the
previously recognised *A. pullulans* species complex. It is therefore
not clear to what extent this knowledge is valid for *A. melanogenum*.
