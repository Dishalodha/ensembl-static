***Claviceps purpurea*** is an ergot fungus that grows on the ears of
rye and related cereal and forage plants. Consumption of grains or seeds
contaminated with the survival structure of this fungus, the ergot
sclerotium, can cause ergotism in humans and other mammals. *C.
purpurea* most commonly affects outcrossing species such as rye (its
most common host), as well as triticale, wheat and barley. It affects
oats only rarely.
