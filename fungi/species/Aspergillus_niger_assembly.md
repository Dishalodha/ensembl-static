The Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Genome Institute
(JGI)](http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Aspni1/Aspni1.home.html) sequenced the
genome of *Aspergillus niger* strain ATCC 1015 at 8.9X coverage using whole genome shotgun
(WGS) sequencing. The version 3.0 of the assembly (June 30, 2008)
contains 8 chromosomes, made up of 21 scaffolds, and 3 unmapped
scaffolds. The 7 of the 8 chromosomes and 1 unmapped scaffold contain
telomeres making *A. niger*'s genome 34.85 MB in
size.
