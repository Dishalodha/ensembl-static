**Black sigatoka** is a leaf-spot disease of banana plants caused by the
ascomycete fungus *Mycosphaerella fijiensis* (Morelet). Also known as
**black leaf streak**, it was discovered in 1963 and named for its
similarities with the yellow sigatoka, which is caused by
*Mycosphaerella musicola* (Mulder), which was itself named after the
Sigatoka Valley in Fiji, where an outbreak of this disease reached
epidemic proportions from 1912 to 1923. Plants with leaves damaged by
the disease may have up to 50% lower yield of fruit and control can take
up to 50 sprays a year.
