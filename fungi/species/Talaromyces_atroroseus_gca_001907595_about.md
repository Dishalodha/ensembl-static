***Talaromyces atroroseus*** is a species of fungus described as new to
science in 2013. Found in soil and fruit, it was first identified from
house dust collected in South Africa. The fungus produces a stable red
pigment with no known toxins that, it is speculated, could be used in
manufacturing, especially mass-produced foods.
