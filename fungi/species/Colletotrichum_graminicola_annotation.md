### Annotation

The assembly and protein coding gene annotation of the *Colletotrichum*
*graminicola* genome was imported from the annotation submitted to
EMBL-Bank as the WGS project
[ACOD00000000](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ACOD00000000). Funding
for the assembly and annotation was provided by the National Institute
of Food and Agriculture ([NIFA](http://www.nifa.usda.gov/index.html))
through the NSF/USDA Microbial Genome Sequencing Program.

Non-coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
