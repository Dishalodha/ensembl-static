***Malassezia sympodialis*** is a species in the genus *Malassezia*. It
is characterized by a pronounced lipophily, unilateral, percurrent or
sympodial budding and an irregular, corrugated cell wall ultrastructure.
It is one of the most common species found on the skin of healthy and
diseased individuals. It is considered to be part of the skin\'s normal
human microbiota and begins to colonize the skin of humans shortly after
birth. *Malassezia sympodialis*, often has a symbiotic or commensal
relationship with its host, but it can act as a pathogen causing a
number of different skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis.
