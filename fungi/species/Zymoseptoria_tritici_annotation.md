### Annotation

The genome sequence, assembly and protein coding genes annotation of the
*Zymoseptoria tritici* genome have been generated by the
[JGI](http://www.jgi.doe.gov/) under funding of the US Department of
Energy\'s Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research
Program, and by the University of California, Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory.

Non coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.

### Expression studies

Transcriptome data for *Zymoseptoria tritici* IPO323 produced by Charlie
Cairns and Ken Haynes at the University of Exeter (BBSRC grant number
BB/I025956/1) is also available for viewing in the browser as BAM
tracks.
