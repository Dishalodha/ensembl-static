***Microsporum gypseum*** is a soil-associated dermatophyte that
occasionally is known to infect the upper dead layers of the skin of
mammals. The name refers to an asexual \"form-taxon\" that has been
associated with four related biological species of fungi: the pathogenic
taxa *Arthroderma incurvatum*, *A. gypsea*, *A. fulva* and the
non-pathogenic saprotroph *A. corniculata*. More recent studies have
restricted *M. gypseum* to two teleomorphic species *A. gypseum* and *A.
incurvatum*. The conidial states of *A. fulva* and *A. corniculata* have
been assigned to *M. fulvum* and *M. boullardii*. Because the anamorphic
states of these fungi are so similar, they can be identified reliably
only by mating. Two mating strains have been discovered, \"+\" and
\"--\". The classification of this species has been based on the
characteristically rough-walled, blunt, club-shaped, multicelled
macroconidia. Synonyms include *Achorion gypseum*, *Microsporum
flavescens*, *M. scorteum*, and *M. xanthodes*. There has been past
nomenclatural confusion in the usage of the generic names *Microsporum*
and *Microsporon*.
