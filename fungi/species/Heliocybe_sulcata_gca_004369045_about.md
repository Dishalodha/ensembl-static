Heliocybe is an agaric genus closely allied to Neolentinus and the bracket
fungus, Gloeophyllum, all of which cause brown rot of wood. Heliocybe sulcata,
the type and sole species, is characterized by thumb-sized, tough, revivable,
often dried, mushroom fruitbodies, with a tanned symmetric pileus that is
radially cracked into a cartoon sun-like pattern of arranged scales and ridges,
distant serrated lamellae, and a scaly central stipe. Microscopically it differs
from Neolentinus by the absence of clamp connections. Like Neolentinus, it
produces abundant, conspicuous pleurocystidia.  Heliocybe sulcata typically
fruits on decorticated, sun-dried and cracked wood, such as fence posts and
rails, vineyard trellises in Europe, branches in slash areas, and semi-arid
areas such on sagebrush or on naio branches in rain shadow areas of Hawaii, or
in open pine forests.
