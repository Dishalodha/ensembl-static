About *Emmonsia parva UAMH 139 (GCA\_001014755)* 
------------------------------------------------



***Emmonsia parva*** (formerly *Chrysosporium parvum*) is a filamentous,
saprotrophic fungus and one of three species within the genus
*Emmonsia*. The fungus is most known for its causal association with the
lung disease, adiaspiromycosis which occurs most commonly in small
mammals but is also seen in humans. The disease was first described from
rodents in Arizona, and the first human case was reported in France in
1964. Since then, the disease has been reported from Honduras, Brazil,
the Czech Republic, Russia, the United States of America and Guatemala.
Infections in general are quite rare, especially in humans.
