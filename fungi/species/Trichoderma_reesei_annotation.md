### Annotation

Gene models have been created using on feature annotation from the
corresponding INSDC records submitted by
[JGI](http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Trire2/Trire2.home.html) as the WGS
project [AAIL2000000](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/AAIL2000000).
Additional non-coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE
(Lowe, T.M. and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and
RNAmmer (Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also
been applied.
