Aspergillus awamori is a species of aspergillus that is used to make awamori and
shōchū. It can produce citric acid and convert starch to sugar. Aspergillus
awamori is often confused with Aspergillus niger as they have very similar
morphologies and growth rates at different temperatures, and produce several
common. In 1901, Tamaki Inui, lecturer at University of Tokyo succeeded in the
first isolating and culturing. In 1910, Genichiro Kawachi succeeded for the
first time in cultivating var. kawachi, a variety of subtaxa of A. awamori. This
improved the efficiency of shōchū production.
