Aspergillus lentulus is a species of Aspergillus fungus. It is a close relative
of Aspergillus fumigatus.  It has smaller conidial heads with diminutive
vesicles compared to A. fumigatus, and cannot survive at . It also has decreased
in vitro susceptibilities to multiple antifungals, including amphotericin B,
itraconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin. Aspergillus lentulus is an
opportunistic human pathogen that causes invasive aspergillosis with high
mortality rates.  It has been isolated from clinical and environmental sources.
Since it was described in 2005 as a new species, it was thought to reproduce
only asexually.  However, in 2013 Swilaiman et al. (2013) found that A. lentulus
has a functional sexual cycle.  During this cycle cleistothecia are produced
that, when mature, contain heat-resistant ascospores.
