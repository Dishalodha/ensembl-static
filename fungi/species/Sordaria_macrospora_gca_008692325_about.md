Sordaria macrospora is a species of coprophilous (dung-colonizing) fungus. It is
one of several fungal model organisms in biology, e.g. the model of fruiting
body development in Ascomycetes. It is a homothallic, self-fertile organism.

spore-color locus, segregate as yellow and black. Different colors patterns
reflect DNA recombination events during meiotic prophase. Lighter colors are due
to incomplete maturation.
