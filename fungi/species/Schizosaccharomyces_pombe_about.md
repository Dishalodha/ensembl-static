About the *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* genome
--------------------------------------------

*Schizosaccharomyces pombe*, or fission yeast, is a single celled
free-living ascomycete fungus with many of the features found in the
cells of multicellular eukaryotes. It provides an excellent model
organism for the study of a number of eukaryotic processes, particularly
cell cycle control, DNA repair and recombination, centromere structure
and function.
