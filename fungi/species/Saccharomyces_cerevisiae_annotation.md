### Annotation

::: {#annotation}
The protein-coding and non-coding gene model annotation was imported
from the Saccharomyces Genome Database
[(SGD)](http://www.yeastgenome.org/) in April 2018. This gene set is
based on [Liachko et al.
2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23241746)
[\[6\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23241746), and contains 7036
protein-coding genes. Additionally, 91 transposable element genes (TE
genes) that were previously annotated as protein-coding genes have now
been correctly captured as TE genes.
