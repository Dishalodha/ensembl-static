About *Penicillium expansum str. CMP-1 (GCA\_000769755)* 
--------------------------------------------------------



***Penicillium expansum*** is a psychrophilic blue mold that is common
throughout the world in soil. It causes Blue Mold of apples, one of the
most prevalent and economically damaging post-harvest diseases of
apples.

Though primarily known as a disease of apples, this plant pathogen can
infect a wide range of hosts, including pears, strawberries, tomatoes,
corn, and rice. *Penicillium expansum* produces the carcinogenic
metabolite patulin, a neurotoxin that is harmful when consumed. Patulin
is produced by the fungus as a virulence factor as it infects the host.
Patulin levels in foods are regulated by the governments of many
developed countries. Patulin is a particular health concern for young
children, who are often heavy consumers of apple products. The fungus
can also produce the mycotoxin citrinin.
