About *Verticillium longisporum (GCA\_001268165)* 
-------------------------------------------------



***Verticillium longisporum,*** also known as Verticillium Wilt, is a
fungal plant pathogen that commonly infects canola. *V. longisporum* can
attack other brassica plants as well as woody ornamentals. A main
symptom of the infected plant is wilting. In America, *V. longsiporum*
primarily effects eudicot plants. This pathogen can be very devastating
and hard to eradicate, responding only to expensive fumigation or fungal
resistant plants.
