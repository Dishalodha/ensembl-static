***Candida glabrata*** is a haploid yeast of the genus Candida,
previously known as *Torulopsis glabrata*. This species of yeast is
non-dimorphic and no mating activity has been observed. Until recently,
*C. glabrata* was thought to be a primarily non-pathogenic organism.
However, with the ever increasing population of immunocompromised
individuals, trends have shown *C. glabrata* to be a highly
opportunistic pathogen of the urogenital tract, and of the bloodstream
(Candidemia). It is especially prevalent in HIV positive people, and the
elderly.

There are two widely cited potential virulence factors that contribute
to the pathogenicity of *C. glabrata*. The first is a series of adhesins
coded by the EPA (epithelial adhesin) genes. These genes, located in the
subtelomeric region, can respond to environmental cues that allow them
to be expressed en masse so the organism can adhere to biotic and
abiotic surfaces in microbial mats. This is also the suspected mechanism
by which *C. glabrata* forms microbial \"biofilms\" on urinary
catheters, and less commonly in-dwelling IV catheters. It also causes
problems with dental devices, such as dentures.
