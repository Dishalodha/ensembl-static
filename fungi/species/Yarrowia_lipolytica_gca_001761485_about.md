About *Yarrowia lipolytica str. CLIB89 (W29) (GCA\_001761485)* 
--------------------------------------------------------------



***Yarrowia*** is a fungal genus in the family Dipodascaceae. For a
while the genus was monotypic, containing the single species *Yarrowia
lipolytica*, a yeast that can use unusual carbon sources, such as
hydrocarbons. This has made it of interest for use in industrial
microbiology, especially for the production of specialty lipids.
Molecular phylogenetics analysis has revealed several other species that
have since been added to the genus.
