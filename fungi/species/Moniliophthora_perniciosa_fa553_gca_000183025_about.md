***Moniliophthora perniciosa*** (previously *Crinipellis perniciosa*) is
a fungus that causes \"witches\' broom disease\" (WBD) of the cocoa tree
(*Theobroma cacao* L.). *T. cacao* a tropical tree with seeds that are
processed into cocoa (=cacao) products. This pathogen is currently
limited to South America, Panama and the Caribbean, and is perhaps one
of the best-known cocoa diseases, thought to have co-evolved with cocoa
in its centre of origin (first recorded in the Brazilian Amazon in
1785).

This fungus is hemibiotroph, with two characteristic phases: biotrophic
(expanding and infecting, on living tissue) and saprotrophic (producing
basidiospores, on necrotic tissue). The biotrophic stage, and what
triggers its switch to a saprotrophic stage, are still not understood.
