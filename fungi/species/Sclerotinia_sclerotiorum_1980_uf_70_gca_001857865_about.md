About *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum 1980 UF-70 (GCA\_001857865)* 
------------------------------------------------------------



***Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*** is a plant pathogenic fungus and can
cause a disease called white mold if conditions are conducive. *S.
sclerotiorum* can also be known as cottony rot, watery soft rot, stem
rot, drop, crown rot and blossom blight. A key characteristic of this
pathogen is its ability to produce black resting structures known as
sclerotia and white fuzzy growths of mycelium on the plant it infects.
These sclerotia give rise to a fruiting body in the spring that produces
spores in a sac which is why fungi in this class are called sac fungi
(Ascomycetes). This pathogen can occur on many continents and has a wide
host range of plants. When *S. sclerotiorum* is onset in the field by
favorable environmental conditions, losses can be great and control
measures should be considered.
