***Rhizophagus irregularis*** (previously known as *Glomus
intraradices*) is an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus used as a soil
inoculant in agriculture and horticulture. In addition, it is one of the
best mycorrhizal varieties of fungi available to mycoforestry, but as it
does not produce fruiting bodies it \"has virtually no market value as
an edible or medicinal mushroom\"

*Rhizophagus irregularis* is also commonly used in scientific studies of
the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on plant and soil
improvement.

Recent molecular analysis of Ribosomal DNA suggested that Glomus
intraradices is not in fact in the genus Glomus at all, and should be
renamed ***Rhizophagus intraradices***.
