About *Tuber melansoporum* 
--------------------------

*Tuber melanosporum*, commonly known as Périgord black truffle, and the
Piedmont white truffle dominate today\'s truffle market. It is named
after the Périgord region in France and grows only with the roots of oak
trees. The underground fruiting body of *Tuber melanosporum* is a
gastronomic delicacy produced by a symbiont native to chalky soils in
southern Europe. The worldwide demand for this truffle has fuelled
intense efforts at cultivation. By sequencing and analysing the genome
scientists hope to identify processes that condition and trigger fruit
body and symbiosis formation, ultimately leading to efficient crop
production. Production is almost exclusively European. In 1900, France
produced around 1,000 metric tonnes of *Tuber melanosporum*. Production
has considerably diminished in the past century, and is now around 20
metric tonnes per year, with peaks at 46 metric tonnes in the best
years. As of December 2009, black truffles were sold for about €1,000
per kilo in a farmer\'s market and €3,940 per kilo in a retail saler.
