### Annotation

The genome sequence, assembly and protein coding genes annotation of the
*Verticillium dahliae* (strain VdLs.17) genome have been generated by
the [Broad
Institute](http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/verticillium_dahliae/Info.html).

The set of non coding RNA genes comprises the genes that are part of the
INSDC release and another independent set annotated using tRNAScan-SE
(Lowe, T.M. and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and
RNAmmer (Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also
been applied.
