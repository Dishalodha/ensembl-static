Wallemia mellicola is a xerophilic fungus of the phylum Basidiomycota, described
in 2015 upon taxonomic revision of the species Wallemia sebi.
W. mellicola has a compact genome of 9.8 Mb with few repeats, which is one of
the smallest genomes in Basidiomycota and in Agaricomycota. Three gene family
expansions that were observed in W. mellicola were considered significant,
including heat shock protein, stress responsive alpha-beta barrel, and amino
acid transporter, and they may be responsible for the survival W. mellicola at
low water activity. Genes involved in High Osmolarity Glycerol signalling
pathway were also found and were suggested to play an important role in the
adaptation to osmotic stress. Wallemia mellicola also have a large number of
transporters that allow it to survive in hyperosmotic conditions. After
sequencing the genomes of additional 25 strains of W. mellicola, these was found
to form a relatively homogeneous and widespread population.
