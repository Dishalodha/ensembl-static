About *Calocera cornea HHB12733 (GCA\_001632435)* 
-------------------------------------------------



***Calocera cornea*** is a jelly fungus that grows on decaying wood. It
is a member of the Dacrymycetales, an order of fungi characterized by
their unique \"tuning fork\" basidia.

Its yellow, finger-like, tapering basidiocarps are somewhat gelatinous
in texture. In typical specimens the basidiocarps become up to 3 mm in
diameter, and 2 cm in height. The hymenium covers the sides of the
basidiocarps, each basidium producing and forcibly discharging only two
basidiospores.
