***Tremella mesenterica*** (common names include **yellow brain**,
**golden jelly fungus**, **yellow trembler**, and **witches\' butter**
The gelatinous, orange-yellow fruit body of the fungus, which can grow
up to diameter, has a convoluted or lobed surface that is greasy or
slimy when damp. It grows in crevices in bark, appearing during rainy
weather. Within a few days after rain it dries into a thin film or
shriveled mass capable of reviving after subsequent rain. This fungus
occurs widely in deciduous and mixed forests and is widely distributed
in temperate and tropical regions that include Africa, Asia, Australia,
Europe, North and South America. Although considered bland and
flavorless, the fungus is edible. *Tremella mesenterica* produces
carbohydrates that are attracting research interest because of their
various biological activities.
