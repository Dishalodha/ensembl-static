***Stachybotrys chartarum***, also called ***Stachybotrys atra***,
***Stachybotrys alternans*** or ***Stilbospora chartarum***, is a black
mold that produces its conidia in slime heads. S. chartarum is known as
***black mold*** or ***toxic black mold*** in the U.S. It is sometimes
found in soil and grain, but the mold is most often detected in
cellulose-rich building materials from damp or water-damaged buildings.
*S. chartarum* was originally discovered on the wall of a house in
Prague in 1837 by Czech mycologist August Carl Joseph Corda. It requires
high moisture content in order to grow and is associated with wet gypsum
material and wallpaper.
