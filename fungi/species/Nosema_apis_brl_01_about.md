About *Nosema apis BRL 01* 
--------------------------



***Nosema apis*** is a microsporidian, a small, unicellular parasite
recently reclassified as a fungus that mainly affects honey bees. It
causes **nosemosis**, also called **nosema**, which is the most common
and widespread of adult honey bee diseases. The dormant stage of *N.
apis* is a long-lived spore which is resistant to temperature extremes
and dehydration, and cannot be killed by freezing the contaminated comb.
Nosemosis is a listed disease with the Office International des
Epizooties (OIE).
