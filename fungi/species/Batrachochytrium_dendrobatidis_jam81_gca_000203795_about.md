***Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis*** ( ), also known as ***Bd*** or the
**amphibian chytrid fungus**, is a fungus that causes the disease
chytridiomycosis in amphibians.

In the decade after it was first discovered in 1998, the disease
devastated amphibian populations around the world, in a global decline
towards multiple extinctions, part of the Holocene extinction. A
recently described second species, *B. salamandrivorans*, also cause
chytridiomycosis and death in salamanders.

Some amphibian species appear to have an innate capacity to withstand
chytridiomycosis infection due to symbiosis with *Janthinobacterium
lividum*. Even within species that generally succumb, some populations
survive, possibly demonstrating that these traits or alleles of species
are being subjected to evolutionary selection.
