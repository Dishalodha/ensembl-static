About *Penicillium roqueforti FM164 (GCA\_000513255)* 
-----------------------------------------------------



***Penicillium roqueforti*** is a common saprotrophic fungus in the
genus *Penicillium*. Widespread in nature, it can be isolated from soil,
decaying organic matter, and plants.

The major industrial use of this fungus is the production of blue
cheeses, flavouring agents, antifungals, polysaccharides, proteases, and
other enzymes. The fungus has been a constituent of Roquefort, Stilton,
Danish blue, Cabrales, Gorgonzola, and other blue cheeses that humans
are known to have eaten since around AD 50; blue cheese is mentioned in
literature as far back as AD 79, when Pliny the Elder remarked upon its
rich flavour.
