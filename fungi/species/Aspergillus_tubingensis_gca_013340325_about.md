Aspergillus tubingensis is a darkly pigmented species of fungus in the genus
Aspergillus section Nigri. It is often confused with Aspergillus niger due to
their similar morphology and habitat. A. tubingensis is often involved in food
spoilage of fruits and wheat, and industrial fermentation. This species is a
rare agent of opportunistic infection.
