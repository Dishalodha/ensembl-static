Zasmidium cellare, also known as cellar mold, is a species of fungus that exists
in dark, ethanol-rich environments and is brown to black in colour. This species
primarily exists in wine and brandy cellars in central and southern Europe, but
can be found in surrounding regions and is thought to be helpful in the wine
making process by some and a hygienic issue by others. and is thought to be
beneficial to the cleanliness of cellar air due to its ability to consume musty
odours.
