About the *Aspergillus terreus* genome
--------------------------------------

<div>

*Aspergillus terreus* is a fungus found in soil, decomposing vegetation
and dust in warmer climates such as tropical and subtropical regions.
*A. terreus* is commonly used in industry to produce important organic
acids, such as itaconic acid and cis-aconitic acid, and enzymes like
xylanase. It was also the initial source for the drug mevinolin
(lovastatin), a drug for lowering serum cholesterol. *A. terreus* can
cause opportunistic infections in people with deficient immune systems.
It also produces aspterric acid and 6-hydroxymellein, inhibitors of
pollen development in *Arabidopsis thaliana.*
