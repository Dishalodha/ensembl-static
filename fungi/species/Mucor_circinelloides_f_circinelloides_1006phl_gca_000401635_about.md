***Mucor circinelloides*** is a dimorphic fungus belonging to the Order
Mucorales (Division Mucormycota). It has a worldwide distribution, found
mostly in soil, dung and root vegetables. This species is described as
not known to be able to produce mycotoxins, however it has been
frequently reported to infect animals such as cattle and swine, as well
as fowl, platypus and occasionally humans. Ketoacidotic patients are
particularly at risk for infection by *M. circinelloides*.
