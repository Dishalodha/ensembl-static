### Assembly

The first genomic assembly of *B. cinerea* strain B05.10 was generated
by the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard^1,^ followed by an improved
draft version^2,^ The present assembly^3^, availabe in Ensembl Fungi
since release 27, was generated by Wageningen University and Syngenta,
was sequenced by a combination of Illumina and PacBio technology (at
\>50 x and \~40 x coverage, respectively), and assembled to 18 gapless
contigs, representing separate chromosomes, of which two are very small
(208 and 247 kb, respectively). Ten of the 18 chromosomes contain
telomeric repeats at both ends. The assembly is fully supported by an
optical map and a genetic linkage map. The total length of the assembly
is 42.65 Mb; sequences lacking in the assembly are 0.27 Mb of telomeric
repeats and 0.58 Mb of rDNA repeats.
