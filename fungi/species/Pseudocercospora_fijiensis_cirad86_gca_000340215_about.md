**Black tsigatoka** is a leaf-spot disease of banana plants caused by
the ascomycete fungus *Mycosphaerella fijiensis* (Morelet). Also known
as **black leaf streak**, it was discovered in 1963 and named for its
similarities with the yellow sigatoka, which is caused by
*Mycosphaerella musicola* (Mulder), which was itself named after the
Sigatoka Valley in Fiji, where an outbreak of this disease reached
epidemic proportions from 1912 to 1923.

According to new terminology, the Tsigatoka disease complex is a cluster
of three closely related fungi---yellow sigatoka (*Pseudocercospora
musae*), eumusae leaf spot (*Ps. eumusae*), and black sigatoka (*Ps.
fijiensis*).

Plants with leaves damaged by the disease may have up to 50% lower yield
of fruit, and control can take up to 50 sprays a year.
