About the *Aspergillus flavus* genome
-------------------------------------

*Aspergillus flavus* is a saprotrophic and pathogenic fungus with a
cosmopolitan distribution. It is best known for its colonization of
cereal grains, legumes and tree nuts. Postharvest rot typically develops
during harvest, storage, and/or transit. *A. flavus* infections can
occur while hosts are still in the field (preharvest), but often show no
symptoms (dormancy) until postharvest storage and/or transport. In
addition to causing preharvest and postharvest infections, many strains
produce significant quantities of toxic compounds known as mycotoxins,
which, when consumed, are toxic to mammals. *A. flavus* is also an
opportunistic human and animal pathogen, causing aspergillosis in
immunocompromised individuals.
