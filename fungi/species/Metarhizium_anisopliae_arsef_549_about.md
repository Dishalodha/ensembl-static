***Metarhizium anisopliae***, formerly known as *Entomophthora
anisopliae* (basionym), is a fungus that grows naturally in soils
throughout the world and causes disease in various insects by acting as
a parasitoid. Ilya I. Mechnikov named it after the insect species it was
originally isolated from: the beetle *Anisoplia austriaca*. It is a
mitosporic fungus with asexual reproduction, which was formerly
classified in the form class Hyphomycetes of the form phylum
Deuteromycota (also often called Fungi Imperfecti).

It has long been recognised that many isolates are specific, and they
were assigned variety status, but they have now been assigned as new
*Metarhizium* species, such as *M. anisopliae*, *M. majus* and *M.
acridum* (which was *M. anisopliae* var. *acridum* and included the
isolates used for locust control). *Metarhizium taii* was placed in *M.
anisopliae* var. *anisopliae*, but has now been described as a synonym
of *M. guizhouense* (see *Metarhizium*). The commercially important
isolate M.a. 43 (a.k.a. F52, Met52, *etc.*), which infects Coleoptera
and other insect orders has now been assigned to *Metarhizium brunneum*.
