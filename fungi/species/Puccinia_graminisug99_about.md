*Puccinia graminis* is an obligate plant pathogen, and the causal agent
of stem rust, serious disease in cereal crops. An epidemic of stem rust
on wheat caused by race TTKSK (sampled in the reference isolate Ug99) is
currently spreading across Africa, Asia and the Middle East and is
causing major concern due to the large numbers of people in these areas
dependent on wheat for sustenance. *Puccinia graminis* Ug99 isolate has
a unique virulence profile that can overcome many key wheat rust
resistance genes and is spreading rapidly. Rust pathogens change
rapidly, often by mutation, resulting in six additional variants now
recognized in the Ug99 lineage.
