Crucibulum is a genus in the Nidulariaceae, a family of fungi whose fruiting
bodies resemble tiny egg-filled bird's nests. Often called "splash cups", the
fruiting bodies are adapted for spore dispersal by using the kinetic energy of
falling drops of rain. The "eggs" inside the bird's nests (technically known as
peridioles) are hard waxy shells containing spores, and tend to stick to
whatever nearby herbage they land on, thus increasing the odds of being consumed
and dispersed by herbivorous animals. Members of this genus are saprobic,
obtaining nutrients from dead organic matter, and are typically found growing on
decayed wood and wood debris. The three known Crucibulum species (C. laeve, C.
parvulum, and C. cyathiforme) are distinguished from other genera of the
Nidulariaceae by their relatively simple funiculus – a cord of hyphae that
connects the peridiole (the "eggs") to the exterior of the bird's nest.
