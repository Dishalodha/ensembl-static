About *Pisolithus tinctorius Marx 270*
--------------------------------------



***Pisolithus arrhizus*** (also spelled **Pisolithus arhizus**) is a
widespread earth-ball like fungus, which may in fact be several closely
related species. It is known in Australia as the **horse dung fungus**
and in Europe as the **Bohemian truffle**. This puffball\'s black
viscous gel is used as a natural dye for clothes. *Pisolithus arrhizus*
is a major component in mycorrhizal fungus mixtures that are used in
gardening as powerful root stimulators.
