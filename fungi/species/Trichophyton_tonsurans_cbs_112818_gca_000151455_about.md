About *Trichophyton tonsurans CBS 112818 (GCA\_000151455)* 
----------------------------------------------------------



***Trichophyton tonsurans*** is a fungus in the family Arthrodermataceae
that causes ringworm infection of the scalp. It was first recognized by
David Gruby in 1844. Isolates are characterized as the \"--\" or
negative mating type of the *Arthroderma vanbreuseghemii* complex. This
species is thought to be conspecific with *T. equinum*, although the
latter represents the \"+\" mating strain of the same biological species
Despite their biological conspecificity, clones of the two mating types
appear to have undergone evolutionary divergence with isolates of the
*T. tonsurans*-type consistently associated with Tinea capitis
(particularly in children) whereas the *T. equinum*-type, as its name
implies, is associated with horses as a regular host. Phylogenetic
relationships were established in isolates from Northern Brazil, through
fingerprinting polymorphic RAPD and M13 markers. There seems to be lower
genomic variability in the *T. tonsurans* species due to allopatric
divergence. Any phenotypic density is likely due to environmental
factors, not genetic characteristics of the fungus.
