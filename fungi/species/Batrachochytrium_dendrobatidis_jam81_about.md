About *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis JAM81* 
--------------------------------------------



***Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis***, ( ) also known as ***Bd*** or the
**amphibian chytrid fungus**, is a chytrid fungus that causes the
disease chytridiomycosis in amphibians. In the decade after it was first
discovered in 1998, the disease devastated amphibian populations around
the world, in a global decline towards multiple extinctions, part of the
Holocene extinction. A recently described second species, *B.
salamandrivorans*, also cause chytridiomycosis and death in salamanders.

Some amphibian species appear to have an innate capacity to withstand
chytridiomycosis infection. Even within species that generally succumb,
some populations survive, possibly demonstrating that these traits or
alleles of species are being subjected to evolutionary selection.
