About *Dactylellina haptotyla CBS 200.50 (GCA\_000441935)* 
----------------------------------------------------------



***Dactylellina haptotyla*** is a common soil-living fungus that
develops structures to capture nematodes as nutrient source. In the
presence of nematodes, spores can germinate into sticky knobs or
non-constricting loops. The fungus traps nematodes with sticky knobs and
non-constricting loops, then breakdown the cuticle, and penetrates the
body of nematodes to obtain nutrients. For its predatory nature,
*Dactylellina haptotyla* is also considered as nematode-trapping fungus
or carnivorous fungus.

In Latin, \"dactylo\" (Greek: δάχτυλο) and \"hapto\" (Greek: ἁπτό) mean
finger and touchable respectively.
