***Aspergillus flavus*** is a saprotrophic and pathogenic fungus with a
cosmopolitan distribution. It is best known for its colonization of
cereal grains, legumes, and tree nuts. Postharvest rot typically
develops during harvest, storage, and/or transit. *A. flavus* infections
can occur while hosts are still in the field (preharvest), but often
show no symptoms (dormancy) until postharvest storage and/or transport.
In addition to causing preharvest and postharvest infections, many
strains produce significant quantities of toxic compounds known as
mycotoxins, which, when consumed, are toxic to mammals. *A. flavus* is
also an opportunistic human and animal pathogen, causing aspergillosis
in immunocompromised individuals.
