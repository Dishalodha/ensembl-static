Puccinia striiformis var. striiformis is a plant pathogen. It causes stripe rust
on wheat, but has other hosts as well. The species is common in Europe and in
more recent years has become a problem in Australia. Infection can cause losses
of up to 40%, and the fungus will infect both winter wheat and spring wheat.
The taxonomy of Puccinia striiformis was revised in 2010. The commonly called
stripe rusts on wheat and grasses were separated into four species based on
molecular and morphological studies: Puccinia striiformis sensu stricto (on
Aegilops, Elymus, Hordeum and Triticum spp.), Puccinia pseudostriiformis (on Poa
spp.), Puccinia striiformoides (on Dactylis spp.) and Puccinia gansensis (on
Achnatherum spp.)
The stripe rust, Puccinia striiformis, can greatly decrease wheat yield in
northern Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (NWFP).
