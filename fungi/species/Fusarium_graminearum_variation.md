### Variation

Variation data has been obtained by comparing the sequenced strain PH-1
with Ëœ0.4-fold coverage of whole-genome shotgun sequence from a second
strain of *F. graminearum*[, GZ3639. The identified 10,308
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the two strains and
mapped SNP positions were directly imported from

submitted to dbSNP and is expected to be part of dbSNP
