***Penicillium digitatum*** (/ˌpɛnɪˈsɪlɪəm/digitatum/) is a mesophilic
fungus found in the soil of citrus-producing areas. It is a major source
of post-harvest decay in fruits and is responsible for the widespread
post-harvest disease in *Citrus* fruit known as green rot or green
mould. In nature, this necrotrophic wound pathogen grows in filaments
and reproduces asexually through the production of conidiophores.
However, *P. digitatum* can also be cultivated in the laboratory
setting. Alongside its pathogenic life cycle, *P. digitatum* is also
involved in other human, animal and plant interactions and is currently
being used in the production of immunologically based mycological
detection assays for the food industry.
