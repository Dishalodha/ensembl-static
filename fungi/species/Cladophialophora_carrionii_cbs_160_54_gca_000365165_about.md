About *Cladophialophora carrionii CBS 160.54 (GCA\_000365165)* 
--------------------------------------------------------------



***Cladophialophora carrionii*** is a melanized fungus in the genus
*Cladophialophora* that is associated with decaying plant material like
cacti and wood. It is one of the most frequent species of
*Cladophialophora* implicated in human disease. *Cladophialophora
carrionii* is a causative agent of chromoblastomycosis, a subcutaneous
infection that occurs in sub-tropical areas such as Madagascar,
Australia and northwestern Venezuela. Transmission occurs through
traumatic implantation of plant material colonized by *C. carrionii*,
mainly infecting rural workers. When *C. carrionii* infects its host, it
transforms from a mycelial state to a muriform state to better tolerate
the extreme conditions in the host\'s body.
