***Pseudogymnoascus destructans*** (formerly known as ***Geomyces
destructans***) is a psychrophilic (cold-loving) fungus that causes
white-nose syndrome (WNS), a fatal disease that has devastated bat
populations in parts of the United States and Canada. Unlike other
species of *Geomyces*, *P. destructans* forms asymmetrically curved
conidia. *Pseudogymnoascus destructans* grows very slowly on artificial
media and cannot grow at temperatures above 20 °C. Phylogenic evaluation
has revealed this organism should be reclassified under the family
*Pseudeurotiaceae*, changing its name to *Pseudogymnoascus destructans*.
