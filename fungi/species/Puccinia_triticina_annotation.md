### Annotation

The protein coding gene annotation of the *Puccinia triticina* genome
was imported from GFF datafiles provided the [Broad
Institute](http://www.broadinstitute.org) of MIT. Funding for the
assembly and annotation was provided by USDA Cooperative State Research,
Education and Extension Service through the Microbial Genome Sequencing
Program with additional funding for the BAC library end-sequencing from
the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

Non-coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
