### Annotation

The assembly and annotation of *Fusarium verticillioides* is provided by
the [Broad Institute](http://www.broadinstitute.org). Non coding RNA
genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M. and Eddy, S.R.
1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer (Lagesen K.,et al
2007); additional analysis tools have also been applied.
