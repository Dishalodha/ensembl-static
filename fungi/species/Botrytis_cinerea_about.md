About the *Botrytis cinerea* genome
-----------------------------------

*Botrytis cinerea* is the causal agent of the grey mold disease.
Similarly to *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*, this Ascomycete can infect a
wide range of plants in any stage of growth and is widespread in all
continents. The most notable host is the wine grape where it not only
causes detrimental bunch rot but, under favourable conditions, is able
to cause a benevolent form of berry colonization called "noble rot".
Grapes infected with noble rot have been used for centuries in the
production of sweet dessert wines. *Botrytis cinerea* can lead to
important economic losses in many dozens of crops and harvested
commodities, including vegetables (lettuce, tomato), fruit (berries,
kiwifruit) and ornamentals (rose).
