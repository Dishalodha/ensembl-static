### Assembly

The Institute for Genomic Research
(TIGR)](http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/cna1/), in collaboration with
[Stanford University](http://www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/C.neoformans/),
sequenced the *Cryptococcus neoformans* var. *neoformans*
strain JEC21 (serotype D) genome at approximately 12.5X coverage using
whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing. TIGR produced the genome
assembly, which integrates the WGS sequence data from TIGR and Stanford
University with closure reads from TIGR and BAC end sequences from the
[Genome Sciences Centre](http://rcweb.bcgsc.bc.ca/cgi-bin/cryptococcus/cn.pl)
and [Dr. Jim Kronstad](http://www.kronstadlab.msl.ubc.ca/),
[University of British Columbia](http://www.ubc.ca/index.html). The sequencing and
assembly of the *Cryptococcus neoformans* JEC21 genome is complete.
The assembly has been loaded from the 14 chromosomes deposited in INSDC as
[GCA\_000091045](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000091045.1).
