Neoscytalidium dimidiatum was first described in 1933 as Hendersonula toruloidea
from diseased orchard trees in Egypt. Decades later, it was determined to be a
causative agent of human dermatomycosis-like infections and foot infections
predominantly in the tropical areas; however the fungus is considered to be
widespread. A newer name, Scytalidium dimidiatum, was applied to synanamorph of
Nattrassia mangiferae, otherwise known as Neofusicoccum mangiferae. Substantial
confusion has arisen in the literature on this fungus resulting from the use of
multiple different names including: Torula dimidiata, Scytalidium dimidiatum,
Fusicoccum dimidiatum, and Hendersonula toruloidea.
