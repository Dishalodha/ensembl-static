*Trichophyton* is a genus of fungi, which includes the parasitic
varieties that cause tinea, including athlete\'s foot, ringworm, jock
itch, and similar infections of the nail, beard, skin and scalp.
Trichophyton fungi are molds characterized by the development of both
smooth-walled macro- and microconidia. Macroconidia are mostly borne
laterally directly on the hyphae or on short pedicels, and are thin- or
thick-walled, clavate to fusiform, and range from 4 to 8 by 8 to 50 μm
in size. Macroconidia are few or absent in many species. Microconidia
are spherical, pyriform to clavate or of irregular shape, and range from
2 to 3 by 2 to 4 μm in size.
