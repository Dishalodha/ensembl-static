***Metarhizium acridum*** is the new name given to a group of fungal
isolates that are known to be virulent and specific to Acrididea.
Previously, this species has had variety status in *Metarhizium
anisopliae* (var. *acridum*); before that, reference had been made to
*M. flavoviride* or *Metarhizium sp.* describing an \"apparently
homologous and distinctive group\" of isolates that were most virulent
against *Schistocerca gregaria* in early screening bioassays.
