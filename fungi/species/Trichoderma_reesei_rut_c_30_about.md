***Trichoderma reesei*** is a mesophilic and filamentous fungus. It is
an anamorph of the fungus ***Hypocrea jecorina***. *T. reesei* has the
capacity to secrete large amounts of cellulolytic enzymes (cellulases
and hemicellulases). Microbial cellulases have industrial application in
the conversion of cellulose, a major component of plant biomass, into
glucose.

Recent advances in the biochemistry of cellulase enzymology, the
mechanism of cellulose hydrolysis (cellulolysis), strain improvement,
molecular cloning and process engineering are bringing *T. reesei*
cellulases closer to being a commercially viable route to cellulose
hydrolysis.
