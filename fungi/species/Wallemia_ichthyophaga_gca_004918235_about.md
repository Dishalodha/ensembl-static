Wallemia ichthyophaga is one of the three species of fungi in the genus
Wallemia, which in turn is the only genus of the class Wallemiomycetes.
W. ichthyophaga requires at least 1.5 M NaCl for in-vitro growth (or some other
osmolyte for an equivalent water activity), and it thrives even in saturated
NaCl solution. This makes it the most halophilic fungus known and distinguishes
it from halotolerant (e.g. Aureobasidium pullulans) and extremely halotolerant
fungi (e.g. Hortaea werneckii), which are able to grow well even in the absence
of salt in the medium. These increase in size almost four-fold when exposed to
high salinity, and the cell wall experiences a three-fold thickening. This
results in a substantially decreased functional cell volume and is thought to be
one of the halotolerance mechanisms of this species. Contrary to what was
observed for the extremely halotolerant H. werneckii, in W. ichthyophaga there
are almost no expansions in metal cation transporter genes and their expression
is not salt-responsive. On the other hand, there is a vast enrichment of
hydrophobins (proteins of cell wall with diverse functions and many
biotechnological uses), which contain an unusually high proportion of acidic
amino acids. High proportion of acidic amino acids is thought to be an
adaptation of proteins to high concentrations of salt.
