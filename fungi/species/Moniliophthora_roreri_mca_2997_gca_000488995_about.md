***Moniliophthora roreri*** is a basidiomycete fungus that causes frosty
pod rot disease, one of the most serious problems for cacao (*Theobroma
cacao*--- the source of chocolate) production in Latin America. This
disease and together with witches' broom disease (caused by *M.
perniciosa*) and black pod rot (caused by *Phytophthora* sp.) constitute
the cacao disease trilogy. It causes serious losses in southwestern
parts of South America; spores are dry and powdery and are spread easily
by water movement, wind, or movement of pods; disease spread is highest
during periods of high rainfall.
