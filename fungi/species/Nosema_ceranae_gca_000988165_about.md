***Nosema ceranae*** is a microsporidian, a small, unicellular parasite
that mainly affects *Apis cerana*, the Asiatic honey bee. Along with
*Nosema apis*, it causes the disease nosemosis, the most widespread of
the diseases of adult honey bees. *N. ceranae* can remain dormant as a
long-lived spore which is resistant to temperature extremes and
dehydration. This fungus has been shown to act in a synergistic fashion
with diverse insecticides such as fipronil or neonicotinoids, by
increasing the toxicity of pesticides for bees, leading to higher bee
mortality. It may thus play an indirect role in colony collapse
disorder.; In addition, the interaction between fipronil and Nosema
ceranae induces changes in male physiology leading to sterility
