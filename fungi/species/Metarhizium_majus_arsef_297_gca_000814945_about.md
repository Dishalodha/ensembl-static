***Metarhizium majus*** is the new name given to a group of fungal
isolates that are known to be virulent against Scarabaeidae, a family of
beetles. Previously, this species has had variety status in *Metarhizium
anisopliae* (var. *majus*) and its name is derived from
characteristically very large spores (typically 2.5--4 µm x 10--14 µm
long) for the genus *Metarhizium*. There has been considerable interest
in developing isolates of this species into mycoinsecticides: especially
for coconut and oil palm beetle pests in SE Asia, the Pacific region and
Africa.

It is an anamorph, its telomorphic form is *Cordyceps
brittlebankisoides*.
