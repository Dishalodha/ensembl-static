***Cryptococcus gattii***, formerly known as *Cryptococcus neoformans*
var *gattii*, is an encapsulated yeast found primarily in tropical and
subtropical climates. Its teleomorph is *Filobasidiella bacillispora*, a
filamentous fungus belonging to the class Tremellomycetes.

*Cryptococcus gattii* causes the human diseases of pulmonary
cryptococcosis (lung infection), basal meningitis, and cerebral
cryptococcomas. Occasionally, the fungus is associated with skin, soft
tissue, lymph node, bone, and joint infections. In recent years, it has
appeared in British Columbia, Canada and the Pacific Northwest. that
global warming may have been a factor in its emergence in British
Columbia. From 1999 through to early 2008, two hundred and sixteen
people in British Columbia have been infected with *C. gattii*, and
eight died from complications related to it. The fungus also infects
animals, such as dogs, koalas and dolphins. In 2007, the fungus appeared
for the first time in the United States, in Whatcom County, Washington
and in April 2010 had spread to Oregon. The most recently identified
strain, designated VGIIc, is particularly virulent, having proved fatal
in 19 out of 218 known cases.
