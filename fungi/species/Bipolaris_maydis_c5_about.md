About *Bipolaris maydis C5* 
---------------------------



***Cochliobolus heterostrophus*** is a fungal plant pathogen. It can
cause Southern corn leaf blight in Maize.

*Cochliobolus heterstrophus* is found in many tropical regions and in
the southern part of the US. *Cochliobolus*, although not currently the
most economically serious disease, can be a very serious crop disease.
*C. heterostrophus* (race O) was considered a mild pathogen of corn, and
was of little worry to those growing maize crops. It was not until the
1970s that *C. heterostrophus* (race T) destroyed more than 15% of the
U.S. corn crop. Race T differed from race O in the sense that it
produced T-toxin (host-selective toxin). The corn planted in the 1970s
carried T-cms; T-cms was particularly susceptible to T-toxin. T-toxin is
considered to be related to a family of linear polyketides.

This organism\'s appeal among genetic analysts lends itself to the
organism\'s superior tractability when \"homologous recombination
between transforming DNA and target genomic sequences\" takes place.
This \"facilitates functional analysis by site-specific gene deletion.\"
