About *Malassezia pachydermatis* 
--------------------------------



***Malassezia pachydermatis*** is a zoophilic yeast in the division
Basidiomycota. It was first isolated in 1925 by Fred Weidman, and has
been named *pachydermatis* Greek for \"thick-skin\" after the original
sample taken from an Indian rhinoceros (*Rhinocerosus unicornis*) with
severe exfoliative dermatis. Within the genus *Malassezia*,
*M. pachydermatis* is most closely related to the species *M. furfur*. A
commensal fungus, it can be found within the microflora of healthy
mammals such as humans, cats and dogs, However, it is capable of acting
as an opportunistic pathogen under special circumstances and has been
seen to cause skin and ear infections, most often occurring in canines.
