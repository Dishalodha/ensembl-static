About *Hortaea werneckii EXF-2000 (GCA\_002127715)* 
---------------------------------------------------



***Hortaea werneckii*** is a species of yeast in the family
Teratosphaeriaceae.

Several salt-tolerance mechanisms of *H. werneckii* have been studied on
molecular level. For example, it is known that its major compatible
solutes are glycerol, erythritol, arabitol, and mannitol; melanin
accumulation of the cell wall aids in retention of at least glycerol
inside of the cell. Several components of the high osmolarity glycerol
(HOG) signalling pathway (which controls responses to osmotic shock)
have been studied in detail and some seem to differ in function compared
to their counterparts in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.

Whole genome sequencing of *H. werneckii* Genes encoding metal cation
transporters, which are thought to play a role in halotolerance,
experienced several additional gene duplications at various points
during their evolution.

A homothallic mating locus was found in all sequenced genomes, although
one of the mating genes may have been inactivated in some strains.
Despite this, phylogenetic analyses and linkage disequilibrium analyses
indicate that *H. werneckii* is asexual.
