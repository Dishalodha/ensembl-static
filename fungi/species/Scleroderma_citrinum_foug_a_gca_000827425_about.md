***Scleroderma citrinum***, commonly known as the **common earthball**,
**pigskin poison puffball**, or **common earth ball**, is the most
common species of **earthball** in the UK and occurs widely in woods,
heathland and in short grass from autumn to winter. *Scleroderma
citrinum* has two synonyms, *Scleroderma aurantium* (Vaill.) and
*Scleroderma vulgare* Horn.

Earthballs are superficially similar to, and considered look-alikes of,
the edible puffball, but whereas the puffball has a single opening on
top through which the spores are dispersed, the earthball just breaks up
to release the spores. Moreover, *Scleroderma citrinum* has much firmer
flesh and a dark gleba (interior) much earlier in development than
puffballs. *Scleroderma citrinum* has no stem but is attached to the
soil by mycelial cords. The peridium, or outer wall, is thick and firm,
usually ochre yellow externally with irregular warts.

The earthball may be parasitized by *Pseudoboletus parasiticus*.

Ingestion of *Scleroderma citrinum* can cause gastrointestinal distress
in humans and animals, and some individuals may experience lacrimation,
rhinitis and rhinorrhea, and conjunctivitis from exposure to its spores.

Pigments found in the fruiting body of Scleroderma citrinum Pers. are
sclerocitrin, norbadione A, xerocomic acid, and badione A.
