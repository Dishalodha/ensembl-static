Cenococcum geophilum Fr., synonym Cenococcum graniforme (Sow.) Ferd. and Winge,
is an Ascomycete fungal species and is the only member in the genus Cenococcum.
It is one of the most common ectomycorrhizal fungal species encountered in
forest ecosystems. The geographic distribution of the species is notably
cosmopolitan;  it is found in ecosystems with a wide range of environmental
conditions, and in many cases in high relative frequency. Because of its wide
distribution and abundance in forest soils, it is one of the most well-studied
ectomycorrhizal fungal species.
While the species has long been known to be sterile and not produce asexual or
sexual spores, cryptic sexual stages may exist. The hyphae produced by C.
geophilum are characterized by their thick (1.5-8 um), straight and jet black
appearance with little branching.  They usually form monopodial (unbranched)
ectomycorrhizas. The mantles of C. geophilum ectomycorrhizas are usually thick
with few to many emanating hyphae.
