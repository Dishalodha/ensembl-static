Talaromyces marneffei, formerly called Penicillium marneffei, was identified in
1956. The organism is endemic to southeast Asia where it is an important cause
of opportunistic infections in those with HIV/AIDS-related immunodeficiency.
Incidence of T. marneffei infections has increased due to a rise in HIV
infection rates in the region.
When it was classified as a Penicillium, it was the only known thermally
dimorphic species of that genus that caused a lethal systemic infection
(talaromycosis), with fever and anaemia similar to disseminated cryptococcosis.
This contrasted with related Penicillium species that are usually regarded as
unimportant in terms of causing human disease.
