Cryomyces minteri is a fungus of uncertain placement in the class
Dothideomycetes, division Ascomycota. The rock-inhabiting fungus that was
discovered in the McMurdo Dry Valleys located in Antarctica, on fragments of
rock colonized by a local cryptoendolithic community.
In 2008, Cryomyces minteri and Cryomyces antarcticus were simultaneously tested
in low earth orbit conditions on the EXPOSE-E facility on the EuTEF (European
Technology Exposure Facility) platform outside the International Space Station
for 18 months.
It was also tested in a space vacuum along with polychromatic UV radiation to
simulate a Martian environment. The two fungi survived both of the simulations.
