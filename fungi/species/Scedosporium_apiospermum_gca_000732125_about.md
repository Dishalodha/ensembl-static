About *Scedosporium apiospermum str. IHEM 14462 (GCA\_000732125)* 
-----------------------------------------------------------------



***Pseudallescheria boydii*** is a species of fungus classified in the
Ascomycota. and pseudallescheriasis. Typically found in stagnant and
polluted water, it has been implicated in the infection of
immunocompromised and near-drowned pneumonia patients. Its asexual
(anamorphic) form is ***Scedosporium apiospermum***. Treatment of
infections with *P.Â boydii* is complicated by its resistance to many of
the standard antifungal agents normally used to treat infections by
filamentous fungi.

*Pseudallescheria boydii* fungal infection was the cause of death in
three athletes submerged in the Yarkon River after a bridge collapsed,
during 1997 Maccabiah Games.
