### Annotation

The protein coding gene annotation of the *Sporisorium reilianum* genome
(generated by the [Munich Information Center for Protein
Sequences](http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/genre/proj/sporisorium/))
was imported from the annotation submitted to EMBL-Bank as the assembly
project
[GCA\_000230245](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000230245).

Non-coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
