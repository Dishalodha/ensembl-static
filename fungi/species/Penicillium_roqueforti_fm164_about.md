***Penicillium roqueforti*** is a common saprotrophic fungus from the
family Trichocomaceae. Widespread in nature, it can be isolated from
soil, decaying organic matter, and plants.

The major industrial use of this fungus is the production of blue
cheeses, flavouring agents, antifungals, polysaccharides, proteases and
other enzymes. The fungus has been a constituent of Roquefort, Stilton,
Danish blue, Cabrales, Gorgonzola and other blue cheeses that humans are
known to have eaten since approximately AD 50; blue cheese is mentioned
in literature as far back as AD 79, when Pliny the Elder remarked upon
its rich flavour.
