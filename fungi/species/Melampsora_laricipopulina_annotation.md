### Annotation

The protein coding gene annotation of the *Melampsora larici-populina*
genome have been generated by the [JGI](http://www.jgi.doe.gov/). The
gene models were imported from the annotation submitted to EMBL-Bank as
the whole shotgun sequencing set
[AECX00000000](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/AECX00000000).

Non-coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
