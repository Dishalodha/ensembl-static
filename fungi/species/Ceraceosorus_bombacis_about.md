About *Ceraceosorus bombacis* 
-----------------------------



The **Ceraceosorales** are an order of smut fungi in the class
Exobasidiomycetes. It is a monotypic order, consisting of a single
family, the **Ceraceosoraceae**, which in turn contain a single
monotypic genus, ***Ceraceosorus***. ***C. bombacis*** is a fungus that
infects the tree *Bombax ceiba* in India. This economically important
tree is used as lumber. Ceraceosorales was circumscribed in 2006; the
family Ceraceosoraceae was validated in 2009. *C. bombacis* was
originally described as *Dicellomyces bombacis* in 1973, but B.K. Bakshi
transferred it to the newly described *Ceraceosorus* three years later.
