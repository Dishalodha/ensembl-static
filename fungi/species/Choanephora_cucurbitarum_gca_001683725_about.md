The fungus ***Choanephora cucurbitarum*** is a plant pathogen that
causes fruit and blossom rot of various cucurbits. It can also affect
okra, snap bean, and southern pea, and may cause a stem and leaf rot of
*Withania somnifera*. Recently Das et al. 2017 added few more
patho-index on *aubergine (Solanum melongena L.),* teasle gourd
(Momordica subangulata Blume subsp. renigera (G. Don) de Wilde*,*
hyacinth bean (Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet)*,* green pea (Pisum
sativum)\'\' from India. ( Wet weather, high temperature and high
humidity favor disease development from inoculum that is typically
soil-borne. Signs of infection on fruits or leaves include water-soaked,
necrotic lesions, which progress rapidly under ideal conditions. As the
fungus begins to produce spores, affected tissues become dark grey-brown
and hairy as a result of the superficial sporangia.
