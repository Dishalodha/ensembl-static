The sequencing, assembly and annotation of protein coding genes from
the *Puccinia graminis* (Ug99) genome has been generated by the
[Broad Institute](http://www.broadinstitute.org/) as part of their work on the
[Puccinia group of fungi](http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/puccinia_group/Info.html).

Non coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
