[The sequencing, assembly and annotation of protein coding genes from
the *Puccinia graminis* (Ug99) genome has been generated by the

Institute](http://www.broadinstitute.org/)[ as part of their work on the
Puccinia group of fungi
(]{style="line-height: 1.5em;"}<http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/puccinia_group/Info.html>[).]{style="line-height: 1.5em;"}

Non coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
