***Puccinia striiformis* var. *striiformis*** is a plant pathogen. It
causes stripe rust on wheat, but has other hosts as well. The species is
common in Europe and in more recent years has become a problem in
Australia. Infection can causes losses of up to 40%, and the fungus will
infect both winter wheat and spring wheat. The taxonomy of Puccinia
striiformis was revised in 2010. The commonly called stripe rusts on
wheat and grasses were separated into four species based on molecular
and morphological studies: Puccinia striiformis sensu stricto (on
Aegilops, Elymus, Hordeum and Triticum), Puccinia pseudostriiformis (on
Poa), Puccinia striiformoides (on Dactylis) and Puccinia gansensis (on
Achnatherum)

The stripe rust, *Puccinia striiformis*, can greatly decrease wheat
yield in northern Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (NWFP).
