Brettanomyces bruxellensis (the anamorph of Dekkera bruxellensis) is a yeast
associated with and named after, the Senne valley near Brussels, Belgium.
It is one of several members of the genus Brettanomyces, a genus first isolated
in 1889 by Seyffert of the Kalinkin Brewery in St.Petersburg as a "Torula" from
English beer which produced the typical "English" taste in lager beer. In 1899
JW Tullo at Guinness described two types of "secondary yeast" in Irish stout.
However N. Hjelte Claussen at the Carlsberg brewery was the first to publish a
description in 1904, following a 1903 patent (UK patent GB190328184) that was
the first patented microorganism in history.  The isolation of an organism
derived from bottles of traditional English beer was described and therefore the
name Brettanomyces was chosen, from "briton" for the British origin and "myces"
for the characterisation as fungus. Despite its Latin species name, B.
bruxellensis is found all over the globe. In the wild, it is often found on the
skins of fruit.
