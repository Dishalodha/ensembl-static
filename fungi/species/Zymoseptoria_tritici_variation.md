### Variation

We constructed a variation database using the resequencing data of
*Zymoseptoria tritici*. Sequence read data for the study
[SRP017760](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/SRP017760) was downloaded
from ENA Short Read Archive and mapped against the *Z.tritici* genome
using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment Tool (Li H.and Durbin R.Bioinformatics
2010) and variation calling was done using SAMtools (Li H.et.al
Bioinfomratics 2009).
