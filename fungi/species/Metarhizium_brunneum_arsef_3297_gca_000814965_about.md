About *Metarhizium brunneum ARSEF 3297 (GCA\_000814965)* 
--------------------------------------------------------



***Metarhizium brunneum***, is the re-instated name of a group of
reassigned *Metarhizium* isolates, previously grouped in the species
\"*Metarhizium anisopliae* var. *anisopliae*\": based on a multigene
phylogenetic approach using near-complete sequences from nuclear DNA. It
is a mitosporic fungus with asexual reproduction, which was formerly
classified in the form class Hyphomycetes of the form phylum
Deuteromycota (also often called Fungi Imperfecti). *M. brunneum* has
been isolated from Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera and soil samples,
but a commercially developed isolate (below) has proved virulent against
Hemiptera and Thysanoptera.
