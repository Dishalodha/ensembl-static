The assembly and protein coding gene annotation of the *Dothistroma septosporum* genome 
was imported from the annotation submitted to INSDC as the WGS project
[AIEN00000000.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/AIEN01000000).
The work conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute is supported by the Office
of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.

Non-coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
