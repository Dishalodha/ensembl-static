Protein-coding gene annotation has been imported from that provided by
the [*Microbotryum violaceum* Sequencing
Project](http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/Microbotryum_violaceum/MultiHome.html),
[Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT](http://www.broadinstitute.org/).

Non coding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe, T.M.
and Eddy, S.R. 1997), RFAM (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and RNAmmer
(Lagesen K.,et al 2007); additional analysis tools have also been
applied.
