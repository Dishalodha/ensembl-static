***Setosphaeria turcica*** (anamorph *Exserohilum turcicum*; formerly
known as *Helminthosporium turcicum*) is the causal agent of northern
corn leaf blight in maize. It is a serious fungal disease prevalent in
cooler climates and tropical highlands wherever corn is grown. It is
characterized by large cigar shaped necrotic lesions that develop on the
leaves due to the polyketide metabolite monocerin.
