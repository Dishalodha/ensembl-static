*Blumeria graminis* is an ascomycete fungus responsible for powdery
mildew in a variety of grasses, including economically important cereals
such as barley and wheat, causing falls in yields of up to 40%. Its
genome exhibits considerable variability, allowing the evolution of
strains that are able to infect previously resistant crop varieties, or
that exhibit fungicide resistance.
