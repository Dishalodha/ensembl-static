About *Botrytis cinerea BcDW1 (GCA\_000349525)* 
-----------------------------------------------



***Botrytis cinerea*** (\"botrytis\" from Ancient Greek *botrys*
(βότρυς) meaning \"grapes\" plus the New Latin suffix *-itis* for
disease) is a necrotrophic fungus that affects many plant species,
although its most notable hosts may be wine grapes. In viticulture, it
is commonly known as \"botrytis bunch rot\"; in horticulture, it is
usually called \"grey mould\" or \"gray mold\".

The fungus gives rise to two different kinds of infections on grapes.
The first, grey rot, is the result of consistently wet or humid
conditions, and typically results in the loss of the affected bunches.
The second, noble rot, occurs when drier conditions follow wetter, and
can result in distinctive sweet dessert wines, such as Sauternes or the
Aszú of Tokaji/Grasă de Cotnari. The species name *Botrytis cinerea* is
derived from the Latin for \"grapes like ashes\"; although poetic, the
\"grapes\" refers to the bunching of the fungal spores on their
conidiophores, and \"ashes\" just refers to the greyish colour of the
spores *en masse*. The fungus is usually referred to by its anamorph
(asexual form) name, because the sexual phase is rarely observed. The
teleomorph (sexual form) is an ascomycete, *Botryotinia fuckeliana*,
also known as *Botryotinia cinerea* (see taxonomy box)
