**About *Bactrocera tryoni***
-------------------------
The Queensland fruit fly is a species of fly in the family Tephritidae 
in the insect order Diptera. B. tyroni is native to subtropical 
coastal Queensland and northern New South Wales. They are active 
during the day, but mate at night. B. tyroni lay their eggs in fruit. 
The larvae then hatch and proceed to consume the fruit, causing the 
fruit to decay and drop prematurely. B. tyroni are responsible for an 
estimated $28.5 million a year in damage to Australian crops and are 
the most costly horticultural pest in Australia. Up to 100% of exposed 
fruit can be destroyed due to an infestation of this fly species. 
Previously, pesticides were used to eliminate B. tyroni from damaging 
crops. However, these chemicals are now banned. Thus, experts devoted 
to B. tyroni control have transitioned to studying this pests' 
behaviors to determine a new method of elimination.
