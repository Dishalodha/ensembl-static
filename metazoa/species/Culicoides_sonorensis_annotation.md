Gene models were constructed de-novo in EMBL-EBI (Hinxton, UK) using
MAKER v2.31.6 resulting in 15,810 protein-coding genes predicted. Gene
predictions were curated and refined using WebApollo v1.0. RNA-Seq data
was obtained as part of the associated *C. sonorensis* genome
publication^1^ and previously reported transcriptome data^2,3^. RNA-Seq
data from the genome associated publication was generated from
BTV-competent, BTV-refractory, blood-fed and sucrose-fed midges which
was then sequenced at Edinburgh Genomics (The University of Edinburgh,
Scotland).
