*AcolN1* assembly
-----------------

*AcolN1* is a high-quality de novo genome assembly from a single
*Anopheles coluzzii* mosquito from the Ngousso colony, as decribed in
the paper [\'A High-Quality De novo Genome Assembly from a Single
Mosquito Using PacBio
Sequencing\'](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6357164/),
Kingan et al, Genes (Basel). 2019 Jan; 10(1): 62. The assembly was
generated using a modified SMRTbell library construction protocol, and
consists of a primary de novo assembly of 372 contigs totaling 266 Mb in
length, 665 alternate haplotigs, and with half of the assembly in
contigs (contig N50) of 3.5 Mb or longer. The additional phased
haplotype sequences spanned a total of 78.5 Mb (i.e., 29% of the total
genome size was separated into haplotypes), with a contig N50 of 223 kb.
A 4.24 Mb bacterial genome, closely related to Elizabethkingia
anophelis, was also identified and removed from the assembly. Two full
length copies of the mitochondrial chromosome were isolated, differeing
by only a single base. One of mtDNA copies was discarded from the final
assembly, and the other retained with the sequence accession CM014284.1.

The new PacBio assembly is highly concordant with the AgamP4 PEST
reference over the entire genome, allowing the placement of the long
PacBio contigs into chromosomal contexts. In addition, the high
contiguity of the PacBio contigs allows for the resolution of many gaps
in the Anopheles gambiaechromosomal PEST strain 'contigs'.
