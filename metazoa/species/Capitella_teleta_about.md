About *Capitella teleta*
------------------------

*Capitella teleta* is a polychaete annelid worm, a class whose members
are also known as bristle worms, due to the chitinous bristles on the
parapodia of each body segment. *C. teleta* is an opportunistic
inhabitant of marine benthic regions, with a worldwide distribution; the
species was only recently given a formal taxonomic name, having
previously been referred to as *Capitella* sp. I \[1\].

*C. teleta* has many characteristics that are representative of annelids
and, more generally, lophotrochozoans, and its genome was sequenced
alongside another annelid ([Helobdella robusta](/Helobdella_robusta))
and a mollusc ([Lottia gigantea](/Lottia_gigantea)) to provide insight
into metazoan evolution \[2\]. The genomic data also promotes the use of
this species as a model organism for studies of evolutionary
development.
