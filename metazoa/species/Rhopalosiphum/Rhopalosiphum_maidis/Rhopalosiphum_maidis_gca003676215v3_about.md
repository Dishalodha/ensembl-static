**About *Rhopalosiphum maidis***
-------------------------
*Rhopalosiphum maidis*, common names corn leaf aphid (*Rhopalosiphum 
maidis*) and corn aphid, is an insect, and a pest of maize and other 
crops. It has a nearly worldwide distribution and is typically found 
in agricultural fields, grasslands, and forest-grassland zones. Among 
aphids that feed on maize, it is the most commonly encountered and 
most economically damaging, particularly in tropical and warmer 
temperate areas. In addition to maize, R. maidis damages rice, 
sorghum, and other cultivated and wild monocots.
