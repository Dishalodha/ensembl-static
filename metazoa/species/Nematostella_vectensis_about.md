About *Nematostella vectensis*
------------------------------

The starlet sea anemone, *Nematostella vectensis*, is a cnidarian, a
phylum that also includes coral, jellyfish and hydras. *N. vectensis*
has a tubular shape (length ranges from about 2 to 6 cm) with a bulbous
area at the basal end (used to burrow into the mud) and an oral disk
containing the mouth and two rings of tentacles at the top end. It has
been observed in salt marshes around the coast of United Kingdom, East
and West coasts of the USA, and Nova Scotia in Canada.

*Nematostella vectensis* can reproduce asexually all year round, and
sexually during summer and autumn. Its sensitivity to hypoxia (low
levels of oxygen) makes it a good indicator for pollution, and *N.
vectensis* are the simplest organism with true tissues. These
characteristics mean that the species is used in a variety of fields,
including evolution, genomics, reproductive biology, developmental
biology and ecology.
