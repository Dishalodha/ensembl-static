Assembly
--------

The *Aedes aegypti* Liverpool AGWG (LVP\_AGWG) strain was sequenced as
part of the Aedes aegypti Genome Working Group (AGWG) effort to improve
the existing Liverpool strain assembly. The LVP\_AGWG strain was
generated from 3 generations of single pair inbreeding from inbred
sub-strain LVPIB12 (Virginia Tech) as detailed in the BioSample record
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN07177802>.

DNA sequencing was performed upon a pool of 80 whole male pupae
siblings.

The genome sequence was produced at Rockefeller University by the Aedes
aegypti Genome Working Group (AGWG). PacBio reads were assembled by
FALCON-Unzip, scaffolded by Hi-C, and gap-filling and polishing
performed by PBJ and arrow. The assembly presented here (*AaegL5.0* June
2017) is chromosome level, and consists of 2,310 scaffolds, totalling
1.278 Gigabases, with a contig N50 of 11.8 Mb and supercontig N50 size
of 409.8 Mb.

The assembly effectively supercedes the AaegL3 assembly, and is the
supported assembly for the
[EnsemblMetazoa](http://metazoa.ensembl.org/). The previous assembly for
the *Aedes aegypti* Liverpool (LVP) strain (AaegL3) is deprecated, but
can be found on [EnsemblMetazoa
archive](http://eg45-metazoa.ensembl.org/).
