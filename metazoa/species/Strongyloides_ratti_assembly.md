Assembly
--------

The reference genome was assembled by the [Parasite Genomic group at the
Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/),
in collaboration with Mark Viney (University of Bristol), using a
combination of capillary, 454 and Illumina paired-end sequence and
[genetic map](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19887089/) data, and
improved using bespoke manual and automated tools (WTSI Strongyloididae
Nematode Genomes Project, submitted).
