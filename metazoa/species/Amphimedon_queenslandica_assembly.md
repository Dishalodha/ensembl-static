Assembly
--------

Genomic DNA was isolated from \~1,500 embryos and larvae obtained from
the brood chambers of a single mother sponge and the genome was
sequenced and assembled by the Joint Genome Institute in 2010. This
\~167 Mb assembly was constructed from \~9x coverage Sanger shotgun
sequencing and covers \~97% of the protein-coding regions. The genome
has a scaffold N50 of 120kb and contig N50 of 11.2kb.
