About *Solenopsis invicta*
--------------------------

*Solenopsis invicta*, the red fire ant, is native to South America, but
has become an invasive pest in many countries, where the ants have
gained notoriety for their aggression and the painful sting from which
their name is derived. Fire ants are eusocial and have been used as a
model species for the study of complex hymenopteran social behaviour,
such as their caste system \[1\] and altruism \[2\].

Additional genomic resources are available for several ant species at
[Hymenoptera Genome Database](https://hymenoptera.elsiklab.missouri.edu) \[3\] and at
[Fourmidable](https://antgenomes.org) \[4\].
