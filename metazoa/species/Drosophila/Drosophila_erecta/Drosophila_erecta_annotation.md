Annotation
----------

Protein-coding and RNA genes, which were annotated with the [NCBI
eukaryotic genome annotation
pipeline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/process/),
were imported from [FlyBase](http://www.flybase.org), release
dere\_r1.05 (FB2017\_04).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/repeat_features). There
are: 207,069 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 14 Mb (9.4% of the
genome); 45,270 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library),
covering 18 Mb (12.1% of the genome); 99,482 Tandem repeats (TRF)
features, covering 15 Mb (9.6% of the genome).

Protein domains were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes protein feature
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/protein_features).
