Assembly
--------

This is the November 2005 genome assembly 2.0 of *Drosophila yakuba*.
The 9.1x whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed and assembly
provided by the Genome Sequencing Center, Washington University School
of Medicine in St. Louis
([WUGSC](http://genome.wustl.edu/genomes/view/drosophila_yakuba)).

The data were assembled using PCAP \[2\] followed by two rounds of
primer-directed sequence improvement targeted at improving regions of
low-quality sequence and closing gaps. The data was re-assembled and
supercontigs were assigned to chromosomes based on their alignment to
the *D. melanogaster* genome. Inversions based on the *D. yakuba*
assembly were then introduced and checked against polytene chromosome
banding data.
