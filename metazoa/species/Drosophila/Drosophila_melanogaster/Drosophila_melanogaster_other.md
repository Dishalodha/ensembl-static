EST Alignments
--------------

*Drosophila melanogaster* ESTs from
[dbEST](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/) were mapped onto the genome
using [Exonerate](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/31).
Drosophila melanogaster cDNA sequences from the
[BDGP](http://www.fruitfly.org) are also aligned to the genome using
Exonerate, and the BDGP \"[Gold
Collection](http://www.fruitfly.org/EST/gold_collection.shtml)\" is
displayed as a separate track in the genome browser.
