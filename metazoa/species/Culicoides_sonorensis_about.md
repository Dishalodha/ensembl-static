About *Culicoides sonorensis*
-----------------------------

The biting midge *Culicoides sonorensis* belonging to the diptera group:
Ceratopogonidae is an important vector of pathogenic arboviruses
(arthropod-borne viruses). The main viral pathogen transmitted by biting
midges is bluetongue virus (BTV), which is prevalent across the USA but
also occurs internationally. Increasingly, outbreaks of BTV infection
have been reported in many parts of Europe while the range of midge
associated BTV infection has also widened. The *C. sonorensis* genome
provides the first attempt at understanding the transmission of
arboviruses outside of previously investigated well-studied arthropod
viral vectors such as the Aedes mosquitos, (separated from midges by
\~220 million years). *C. sonorensis* represents the first genome
resource for understanding the transmission of non-zoonotic arbovirus
and the drivers of susceptibility of infection in ruminants (Cows, sheep
etc.) and wildlife (deer and equine). Culicoides has other interesting
biological characteristics including the capacity for reaching huge
population densities and their ability for long-distance dispersal by
semi-passive flight under susceptible conditions.
