**About *Ooceraea biroi***
-------------------------
*Ooceraea biroi*, the clonal raider ant (*Ooceraea biroi*), is a 
queenless clonal ant in the genus Ooceraea. Native to the Asian 
mainland, this species has become invasive on tropical and subtropical 
islands throughout the world. Unlike most ants, which have 
reproductive queens and mostly nonreproductive workers, all 
individuals in a O. biroi colony reproduce clonally via thelytokous 
parthenogenesis. Like most dorylines, O. biroi are obligate 
myrmecophages and raid nests of other ant species to feed on the 
brood.
