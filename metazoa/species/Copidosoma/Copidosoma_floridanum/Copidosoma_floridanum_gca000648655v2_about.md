**About *Copidosoma floridanum***
-------------------------
*Copidosoma floridanum* is a species of wasp in the family Encyrtidae 
which is primarily a parasitoid of moths in the subfamily Plusiinae. 
It has the largest recorded brood of any parasitoidal insect, at 3,055 
individuals. The life cycle begins when a female oviposits into the 
eggs of a suitable host species, laying one or two eggs per host. Each 
egg divides repeatedly and develops into a brood of multiple 
individuals, a phenomenon called polyembryony. The larvae grow inside 
their host, breaking free at the end of the host's own larval stage.
