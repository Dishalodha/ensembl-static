Assembly
--------

The *H. microstoma* genome was sequenced by the [Berriman lab at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/), in collaboration with [Pete Olson](http://www.olsonlab.com/) (Natural History Museum, London). The initial version of the genome was described in [Tsai et al (2013)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23485966). Assembly presented here is the third consecutive version of the assembly [HMN_v3](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000469805.3), created by scaffolding a de novo PacBio assembly using Bionano's hybrid scaffolder (optical mapping). Further improvement was then carried out in gap5 using all the available optical map and sequence data.
