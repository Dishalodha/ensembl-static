Ensembl Metazoa displays the v2.2 gene set produced by the [OIST
Molecular Genetics Unit](https://groups.oist.jp/molgenu/octopus-genome).
Genes were annotated with the DOE Joint Genome Institute pipeline, which
combines transcriptomic data with *de novo* and homology-based
prediction methods \[1\]. Protein features and cross-references have
been computed by Ensembl Metazoa.
