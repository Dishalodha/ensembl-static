**About *Ceratitis capitata***
-------------------------
*Ceratitis capitata*, commonly known as the Mediterranean fruit fly 
(*Ceratitis capitata*) or medfly is a yellow and brown fly native to 
sub-Saharan Africa. C. capitata has no near relatives in the Western 
Hemisphere and is considered to be one of the most destructive fruit

the states of California, Florida, and Texas requiring extensive 
eradication efforts to prevent the fly from establishing itself in the 
US.
