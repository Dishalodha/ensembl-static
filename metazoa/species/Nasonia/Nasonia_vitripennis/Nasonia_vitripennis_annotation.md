Annotation
----------

The original genome annotation was generated using the NCBI gene
prediction pipeline, Augustus, and Fgenesh++. A consensus gene set was
produced using GLEAN. This gene set was refined to generate the Official
Gene Set v1.2, imported into Ensembl Metazoa from
[NasoniaBase](http://hymenopteragenome.org/nasonia). These genes were
annotated on version 1.0 of the assembly; Ensembl Metazoa has mapped
them to assembly version 2.1, which consists of almost the same
supercontigs as version 1.0, assembled into chromosomes. Non-coding RNA
genes were added using the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/ncrna), and BLAST hits and
protein features have been computed.
