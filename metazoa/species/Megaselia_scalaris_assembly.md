Assembly
--------

The Durham, NC isolate 2 strain of *Megaselia scalaris* was sequenced by
the [Noor lab at Duke](http://sites.google.com/site/noorlabduke),
generating \~303Mb with contig N50=932. Contigs were assembled into
231,743 scaffolds, 702 of which derive from pairwise alignments with
*Drosophila melanogaster* or *Glossina morsitans*.
