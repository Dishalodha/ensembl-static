Annotation
----------

The annotations in Ensembl Metazoa are the OGSv3.2 gene set \[2\],
imported from
[BeeBase](http://hymenopteragenome.org/beebase/?q=download_sequences)
\[3\]. Non-coding RNA genes were added using the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/ncrna), and BLAST hits and
protein features have been computed.
