Annotation
----------

Genes were annotated with EST-based approaches and the NCBI Gnomon
pipeline, and combined using GLEAN. These gene models have been refined
by manual annotation, and Ensembl Metazoa uses version 2.1b of the
offical gene set, imported from
[AphidBase](http://www.aphidbase.com/Downloads) \[2\].

BLAST hits, protein features, and cross-references have been computed by
Ensembl Metazoa.
