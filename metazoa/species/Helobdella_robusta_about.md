About *Helobdella robusta*
--------------------------

*Helobdella robusta* is a freshwater leech, a type of annelid with
anterior and posterior suckers that are used for locomotion and feeding
(on blood or soft body parts). Leeches are hermaphroditic, and some
species, including *H. robusta*, show a considerable degree of parental
care. During oviposition, up to 100 eggs are attached to the mother in
cocoons, and an adhesive gland ensures that the hatchlings remain
attached; the young leeches continue to cling on after their suckers
develop, during which time they feed on snails killed by their mother
\[1\].

*H. robusta* has many characteristics that are representative of
annelids and, more generally, lophotrochozoans, and its genome was
sequenced alongside another annelid ([Capitella
teleta](/Capitella_teleta)) and a mollusc ([Lottia
gigantea](/Lottia_gigantea)) to provide insight into metazoan evolution
\[2\]. The genomic data also promotes the use of this species as a model
organism for studies of evolutionary development.
