The **Hessian fly** or **barley midge**, *Mayetiola destructor*, is a
species of fly that is a significant pest of cereal crops including
wheat, barley and rye. Though a native of Asia it was transported into
Europe and later into North America, supposedly in the straw bedding of
Hessian troops during the American Revolution (1775--83). There are
usually two generations a year but may be up to five. In the spring the
dark-coloured female lays about 250 to 300 reddish eggs on plants,
usually where the stems are covered by leaves; the larvae feed on the
sap and weaken the plants so that they cannot bear grain.
