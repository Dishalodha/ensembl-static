About *Danaus plexippus*
------------------------

Each autumn millions of the migratory Monarch Butterfly, *Danaus
plexippus*, undergo a long-distance migration of up to 4,000 km from
eastern North America to their wintering grounds in central Mexico.
During this migration, the Monarch uses a time-compensated sun compass
to allow them to maintain a southerly direction. In addition to the
great opportunities for studying circadian clockwork and the molecular
basis of long-distance migration, the mimicry complex formed by the
Monarch and the Viceroy butterflies offers insights into adaptive
evolution.[1]
