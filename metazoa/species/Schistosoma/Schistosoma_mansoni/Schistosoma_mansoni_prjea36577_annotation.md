Annotation
----------

Putative gene models from the annotation accompanying previous assembly GCA_000237925.2 ([Protasio et al 2012](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22253936)) and predictions using RNASeq data were resolved through manual curation using [Apollo](http://genomearchitect.github.io/) as a platform. For unchanged gene models, previous gene identifiers have been preserved [Buddenborg et all](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.13.456314v1).
