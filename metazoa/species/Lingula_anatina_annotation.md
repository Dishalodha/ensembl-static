----------

Ensembl Metazoa displays the v1.0 gene set from the [OIST Marine
Genomics
Unit](http://marinegenomics.oist.jp/lingula/viewer/info?project_id=47).
Genes were annotated by combining transcriptomic data with *de novo*
prediction methods \[1\]. Protein features and cross-references have
been computed by Ensembl Metazoa.
