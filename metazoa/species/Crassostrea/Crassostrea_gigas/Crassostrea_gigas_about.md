About *Crassostrea gigas*
-------------------------

The Pacific oyster, *Crassostrea gigas*, also referred to as *Magallana gigas*,
is a bivalve mollusc with vital roles in coastal ecosystems and aquaculture globally.
Pacific oysters are sessile organisms that thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions.
Although native to Asia, they have been introduced to most continents for farming purposes.
In some areas, self-sustaining populations have been established, leading to *C. gigas* being
recognised as an invasive species. The expansion of specific gene families appears to be an important evolutionary adaptation strategy of *C. gigas*. The Pacific oyster has many
characteristics that are representative of molluscs and,
more generally, lophotrochozoans.
Its genome provides insight into metazoan evolution and is a valuable
resource for aquaculture research \[1, 2\].
