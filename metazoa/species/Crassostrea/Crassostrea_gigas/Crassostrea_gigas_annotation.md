Annotation
----------

Genome annotation was carried out using long-read PacBio Iso-Seq data from six distinct male and female tissue samples (gill, mantle, digestive gland, heart, adductor muscle and gonads)[1] in addition to the Illumina paired-end RNA-seq data available from Zhang et al. 2012 [2].

Gene models were created by BRAKER v.2.1.5 with GeneMark v.4.61_lic and Augustus v3.3.3 using only the paired-end RNA-seq datasets. The Iso-Seq transcript models were generated by mapping the PacBio full length non-chimeric reads to the oyster assembly by minimap2 v.2.16.

The short-read and long-read transcript models were merged using tama_merge from the TAMA package (https://github.com/GenomeRIK/tama/). Protein-coding transcripts and translation start and end positions were predicted by mapping known protein sequences from UniRef90 to the oyster transcripts with Diamond v.0.9.31.
