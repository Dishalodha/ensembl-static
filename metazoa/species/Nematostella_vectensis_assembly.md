Assembly
--------

The genome of *Nematostella vectensis* was sequenced and assembled by
the Joint Genome Institute
([JGI](http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Nemve1/Nemve1.home.html)) \[1\]. The
genome assembly, constructed with the JGI assembler Jazz, includes
approximately 7x WGS in small insert end-sequence coverage. After
cleaning, 10,804 scaffolds were assembled, containing about 296 million
base pairs (Mbp), and 356 Mbp of sequence.
