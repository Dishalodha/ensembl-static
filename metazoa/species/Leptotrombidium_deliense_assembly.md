Assembly
--------

The [*Leptotrombidium deliense*
genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_003675905.1) was
sequenced and assembled at the University of Liverpool.

The LdelU1 assembly was produced from a pool of 50 larvae. The DNA from
the pool was partially degraded but of sufficient quality for sequencing
(full details are availabale in [\"Genomes of trombidid mites reveal
novel predicted allergens and laterally transferred genes associated
with secondary metabolism\", Makepeace BL et al, GigaScience,
2018](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/7/12/giy127/5160133).
Assembly was conducted using Velvet to produce a preliminary assembly
that was filtered for contaminants using blobtools, followed by a second
assembly of the filtered reads using the SPAdes assembler.

The final assembly comprosises 66,710 scaffolds (N50 = 2,941bp), with a
total sequence length of 117,319,042bp (slightly smaller than the
estimate of 158.31--160.95 Mb based on kmer analysis).
