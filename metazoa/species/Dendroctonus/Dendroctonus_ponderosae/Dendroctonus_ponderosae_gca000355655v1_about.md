**About *Dendroctonus ponderosae***
-------------------------
*Dendroctonus ponderosae*, the mountain pine beetle, is a destructive
pest of pine trees in increasingly large regions of North America \[1\].
It has a hard black exoskeleton, and 
measures approximately 5 millimetres, about the size of a grain of 
rice. The beetle carries blue-stain fungus (*[Grosmannia
clavigera](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000143105)* \[2\]), a
symbiont that enables the beetles to extract nutrients from the tree.
Infestation by many beetles (which coordinate attacks with pheromones)
can be fatal to the tree because the fungus produces filaments that
block water transport. The [Tria project](http://www.thetriaproject.ca)
provides genomic resources for the mountain pine beetle, blue-stain
fungus, pine tree, and related-species, to assist researchers in
understanding the ecological dynamics of these species.

The mountain pine beetle is the second coleopteran genome to be
sequenced (the other is [*Tribolium
castaneum*](/Tribolium_castaneum/Info)), and provides a valuable
comparative resource for this inordinately speciose order.
