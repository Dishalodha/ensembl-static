**About *Diuraphis noxia***
-------------------------
The Russian wheat aphid (*Diuraphis noxia*) is an aphid that can cause 
significant losses in cereal crops. The species was introduced to the 
United States in 1986 and is considered an invasive species there. 
This aphid is pale green and up to 2 mm long. Cornicles are very 
short, rounded, and appear to be lacking. There is an appendage above 
the cauda giving the aphid the appearance of having two tails. The 
saliva of this aphid is toxic to the plant and causes whitish striping 
on cereal leaves. Feeding by this aphid will also cause the flag leaf 
to turn white and curl around the head causing incomplete head 
emergence. Its host plants are cereal grain crops including wheat and 
barley and to a lesser extent, wild grasses such as wheatgrasses, 
brome-grasses, ryegrasses and anything in the grass family.
