About *Crassostrea gigas*
-------------------------

*Crassostrea gigas*, the Pacific oyster, is native to Asia, but has been
introduced around the world, intentionally for aquaculture, and
accidentally such that it is sometimes viewed as an invasive species.
Oysters are sessile bivalve molluscs, and *C. gigas* is a large
estuarine species that thrives in a wide range of environmental
conditions, helping to make it the most commercially important oyster
species in the world. The Pacific oyster has many characteristics that
are representative of molluscs and, more generally, lophotrochozoans,
and its genome provides insight into metazoan evolution, in addition to
being a valuable resource for studies of aquaculture \[1\].
