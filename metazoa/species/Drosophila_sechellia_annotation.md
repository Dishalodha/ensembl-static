Annotation
----------

Protein-coding and RNA genes were imported from
[FlyBase](http://www.flybase.org), release dsec\_r1.3 (FB2017\_04).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/repeat_features). There
are: 227,447 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 17 Mb (10.3% of
the genome); 68,547 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library),
covering 30 Mb (17.8% of the genome); 77,058 Tandem repeats (TRF)
features, covering 15 Mb (9.0% of the genome).

Protein domains were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes protein feature
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/protein_features).
