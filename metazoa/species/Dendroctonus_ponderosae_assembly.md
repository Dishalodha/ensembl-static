Assembly
--------

The *D. ponderosae* genome was assembled at the [University of British
Columbia](http://www.msl.ubc.ca) and [Canada's Michael Smith Genome
Sciences Centre](http://www.bcgsc.ca), into 8,188 scaffolds, spanning
204Mbp, with a scaffold N50 of 629Kbp. The life cycle of the beetle
makes laboratory rearing infeasible, so the assembly consists of
high-coverage paired-end short reads from a field-collected male,
scaffolded with short read data from a mixed-sex pool of field-collected
pupae \[1\]. The assembly was refined with EST and RNA-seq data from
different tissues and life stages.
