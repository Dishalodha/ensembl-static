--------------------------------

The **Asian long-horned beetle** (*Anoplophora glabripennis*), also
known as the starry sky, sky beetle, or ALB, is native to eastern China,
Japan, and Korea. This species has now been accidentally introduced into
the United States, where it was first discovered in 1996, as well as
Canada, Trinidad, and several countries in Europe, including Austria,
France, Germany, Italy and UK. Adults are very large insects with bodies
ranging from 1.7 to 3.9 cm in length, and antennae which can be as long
as 4 cm. They are shiny black with about 20 white spots on each wing
cover and long antennae conspicuously banded black and white.
