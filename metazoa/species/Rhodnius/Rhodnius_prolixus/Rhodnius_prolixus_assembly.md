Assembly
--------

*Rhodnius prolixus* was sequenced by the Washington University School of
Medicine, Genome Sequencing Center
([WUGSC](http://genome.wustl.edu/genomes/detail/rhodnius-prolixus)) to a
depth of 8.1x coverage, and assembled using the CABOG assembler. DNA was
isolated from the colony at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,
USA. WGS sequence was released to GenBank in April 2015:
[ACPB00000000.3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/ACPB00000000.3).
This assembly version RproC3, also known as Rhodnius\_prolixus-3.0.3, is
composed of 16,537 supercontigs.
