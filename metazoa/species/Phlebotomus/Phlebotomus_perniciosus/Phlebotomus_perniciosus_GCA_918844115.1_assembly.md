**Assembly**
------------------------
The genome assembly presented here is linked to the assembly accession [[GCA\_918844115.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_918844115.1)]. This genome assembly was produced as part of the Infravec2 project "De novo genome for Infravec. A hematophagous fly Phlebotomus perniciosus, Murcia strain assembly." to study *P. perniciosus*. The assembly was produced using MegaHit v1.2.9 [3]. This material sampled from *P. perniciosus* strain 'Murcia', made available as biological resource for distribution via the Infravec product catalog (https://infravec2.eu/). The assembly 
produced from a single genomic gDNA Illumina PE library "SAMEA10651172" ([ERX6791865](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERX6791865)).

The finalised assembly is composed of 82,538 scaffolds, total length of 165.5Mb (4.4% scaffolds > 10Kb), a contig N50 of 8,432Kb and an L50 of 4,405.
Draft quality and performance assessed with comparison to another sand fly (Phlebotomous); the *P. pappatasi* reference assembly **GCA_000262795.1**.
