About *Zootermopsis nevadensis*
-------------------------------

*Zootermopsis nevadensis*, the Nevada dampwood termite, is part of the
Termopsidae family, and is native to the northwest regions of North
America.

Nevada dampwood termites live in colonies with as many as 4,000 members,
separated into morphologically distinct castes according to their role
in colony; for example, workers are pale brown with large abdomens,
swarmers are darker and have wings, and soldiers have large, dark heads
and jaws (as shown in the image used on this site). *Zootermopsis
nevadensis* is a model species for social behaviour, which contrasts (in
some ways) with that of distantly-related social ant and bee species
\[1\].

As might be guessed from the name, dampwood termites feed mostly on wood
that is near water or in close contact with soil, but can attack all
wood types. They are less of a pest than subterranean or drywood
termites, but all termites are sufficiently closely-related that the *Z.
nevadensis* genome is expected to help find targets for pesticides.
