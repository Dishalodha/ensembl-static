Assembly
--------

The *Capitella teleta* genome (v1.0, August 2007) was sequenced to 7.9x
coverage, and assembled with the
[JGI](http://genome.doe.gov/Capca1/Capca1.info.html) software, Jazz.
After quality control, the paired-end reads assembled into 20,803
scaffolds, giving a genome size of approximately 333 Mb.
