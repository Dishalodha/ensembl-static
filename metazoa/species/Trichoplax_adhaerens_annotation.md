Annotation
----------

Genome annotation involved an *ab initio* approach using FGENESH and
homology-based methods using FGENESH+ and Genewise. There are 11,520
non-redundant gene predictions constitute in release 1.0 of the gene
set. Noncoding RNA genes have been annotated using tRNAScan-SE (Lowe,
T.M. and Eddy, S.R. 1997), Rfam (Griffiths-Jones et al 2005), and
RNAmmer (Lagesen K.,et al 2007); BLAST hits, protein features, and
cross-references have also been computed.
