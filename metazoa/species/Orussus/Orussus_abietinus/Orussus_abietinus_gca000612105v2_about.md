**About *Orussus abietinus***
-------------------------

*Orussus* is a genus within the family Orussidae collectively known as "parasitic wood wasps". 
There are about eleven described species in the genus. This species Ectoparasitize woodboring 
insect larvae, usually Buprestidae (Coleoptera)(1). The Orussidae or the parasitic wood wasps 
represent a small family of sawflies ("Symphyta"). They take a key position in phylogenetic 
analyses of Hymenoptera, because they form the sister taxon of the megadiverse apocritan wasps, 
and the common ancestor of Orussidae + Apocrita evolved parasitism for the first time in course 
of the evolution of the Hymenoptera. They are also the only sawflies with carnivorous larvae.
