About *Rhodnius prolixus*
-------------------------

*Rhodnius prolixus* is a triatomine vector of the Chagas disease
parasite, *Trypanosoma cruzi*, in South and Central America. Chagas
disease is a chronic condition which affects 8 to 10 million people and
is the cause of around 20,000 deaths per year. Triatomine insects
release parasites in their faeces immediately after a blood meal.
Infection occurs after the human host scratches the bite area, thus
transferring parasites into the bite wound.
