The **common eastern bumblebee** (*Bombus impatiens*) is the most
commonly encountered bumblebee across much of eastern North America.
They can be found in the Eastern Temperate Forest region of the eastern
United States, southern Canada, and the eastern Great Plains. Because of
their great adaptability, they can live in country, suburbs, and even
urban cities. This adaptability makes them a great pollinator species,
leading to an increase in their commercial use by greenhouse industry.
This increase consequently led to their farther spread outside their
previous distribution range. They are considered one of the most
important species of pollinator bees in North America.
