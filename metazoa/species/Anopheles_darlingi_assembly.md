*AdarC3* assembly
-----------------

This assembly was generated by the Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao
Cientifica in Petropolis, Brazil from whole genome shotgun assembly of
Roche 454 sequences using the Celera Assember. Changes from the previous
assembly reflect additional 60 scaffolds which were submitted to GenBank
not in the original submission to VectorBase.
