chelicerate arthropod. Despite their name, horseshoe crabs are more 
closely related to spiders, ticks, and scorpions than to crabs. It is 
found in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic coast of North 
America. The main area of annual migration is Delaware Bay along the 
South Jersey Delaware Bayshore.
