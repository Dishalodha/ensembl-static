The T.muris 2.x reference genome has been sequenced by the [Berriman Lab](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/) in collaboration with [Richard Grencis, University of Manchester](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/richard.grencis.html), as described by [Foth et al (2014)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24929830).
The 3.x reference assembly is an improvement adding more sequencing data by the [Berriman Lab](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/).
