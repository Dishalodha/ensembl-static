Assembly
--------

The *Crassostrea gigas* genome was assembled in a hierarchical manner
with a combination of fosmid pooling and whole-genome shotgun
sequencing. The assembly consists of 7,658 scaffolds, with a genome size
of approximately 558 Mb. The assembly displayed in Ensembl Genomes is
derived from INSDC records, and excludes \~4000 very short scaffolds
from the [original assembly data](http://gigadb.org/dataset/100030).
