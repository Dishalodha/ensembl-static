Annotation
----------

The annotation of *Teleopsis dalmanni* was performed at the University
of Maryland. Only [*Teleopsis*
RNA-Seq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/240197) transcripts
\[1, 2\] were used as EST evidence (no dipteran proteins), and *ab
initio* prediction with SNAP. Two rounds of training we done with SNAP
as the *ab initio* predictor using a [\"bootstrapping\"
approach](http://weatherby.genetics.utah.edu/MAKER/wiki/index.php/MAKER_Tutorial_for_GMOD_Online_Training_2014#Training_ab_initio_Gene_Predictors).
The annotation was performed by researchers at UMD (Jerry Wilkinson),
SUNY Geneseo (Josie Reinhardt), and the American Museum of Natural
History (Rick Baker).
