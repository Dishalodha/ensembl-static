Assembly
--------

A shotgun genome assembly of the stalk eyed fly *Teleopsis dalmanni*
(inbred strain 2A) was produced using a combination of Pacific
Biosciences, Roche 454, and Illumina sequencing data. It was submitted
by the University of Maryland (UMD) to ENA under the accession number
[GCA\_002237135.1](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_002237135.1).
The assembly was generated by researchers at UMD (Jerry Wilkinson,
Aleksey Zimin and the UMD Genome Assembly Group), SUNY Geneseo (Josie
Reinhardt), and the American Museum of Natural History (Rick Baker).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/repeat_features). There
are: 1724973 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 79 Mb (12.8% of
the genome); 12915 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library),
covering 3 Mb (0.5% of the genome); 492976 Tandem repeats (TRF)
features, covering 41 Mb (6.5% of the genome).
