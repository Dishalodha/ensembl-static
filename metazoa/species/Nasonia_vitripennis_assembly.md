Assembly
--------

*Nasonia vitripennis* was sequenced to 6.2 times coverage using Sanger
sequencing. Genomic sequence came from the highly inbred AsymCX strain.
Sequencing was carried out at the [Human Genome Sequencing Center at
Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu), and the Atlas
genome assembly software was used for assembly. Ensembl Metazoa contains
the chromosomal assembly, version 2.1.
