Assembly
--------

The sequencing was done at the [Baylor College of
Medicine](http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/), Houston, Texas, to a depth of
22x coverage with 454 technology and 16x coverage with Illumina.
Assembly and scaffolding were performed with CABOG. Assembly of
scaffolds into chromosomal linkage groups was carried out using a RAD
sequence library. The final assembly, Hmel1, has 4,309 scaffolds with a
scaffold N50 of 196 kb, representing 270 Mb. In total, 1,745 scaffolds
were placed on chromosomes, covering 218 Mb (81%) of the genome. The
data in Ensembl Genomes is a direct import of Hmel v1.1 from the
[Heliconius Genome Consortium](http://www.heliconius.org/), imported in
March 2012, supplemented with additional cross-references and protein
annotations.
