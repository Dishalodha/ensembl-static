*AdirW1* assembly
-----------------

This assembly was generated using 101 bp paired-end Illumina HiSeq2000
reads generated from three libraries: a 180 bp insert 'fragment'
library, a 1.5 kb 'jump' library, and a 38 kb 'fosill' library.
Sequencing template for the fragment and jump libraries was derived from
genomic DNA extracted from a single individual, which was preserved by
freezing at -80C. Native genomic DNA was used for the fragment library
and whole genome amplified DNA was used for the jump library. Template
for the fosill library was generated from a pooled extraction of many
individuals. Reads were assembled at the Broad Institute using the
ALLPATHS LG algorithm, with the Haploidify option enabled to address
high allelic heterozygosity in the template.
