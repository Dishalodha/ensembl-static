Assembly
--------

The *Helobdella robusta* genome (v1.0, September 2007) was sequenced to
7.9x coverage, and assembled with the
[JGI](http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Helro1/Helro1.info.html) software, Jazz.
After quality control, the paired-end reads assembled into 1,991
scaffolds, giving a genome size of approximately 235 Mb.
