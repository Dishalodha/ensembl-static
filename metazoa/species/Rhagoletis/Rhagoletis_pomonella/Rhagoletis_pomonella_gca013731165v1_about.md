**About *Rhagoletis pomonella***
-------------------------
The apple maggot (*Rhagoletis pomonella*), also known as the railroad 
worm, is a species of fruit fly, and a pest of several types of 
fruits, especially apples. This species evolved about 150 years ago 
through a sympatric shift from the native host hawthorn to the 
domesticated apple species Malus domestica in the northeastern United 
States. This fly is believed to have been accidentally spread to the 
western United States from the endemic eastern United States region 
through contaminated apples at multiple points throughout the 20th 
century. The apple maggot uses Batesian mimicry as a method of 
defense, with coloration resembling that of the forelegs and pedipalps 
of a jumping spider.
