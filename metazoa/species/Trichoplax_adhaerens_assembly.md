Assembly
--------

The *T. adhaerens* genome was sequenced and assembled by the [Joint
Genome Institute](http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Triad1/Triad1.home.html) in
August 2006. It consists of about 98 Mb in 1,415 scaffolds. The
annotations were released in July 2007 and published in 2008. In release
19 of Ensembl Metazoa we removed a supercontig (scaffold\_3840) that had
been in previous releases, to ensure consistency with the [INSDC
record](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000150275).
