Annotation
----------

The annotations in Ensembl Metazoa were imported from
[SpBase](http://www.spbase.org/). SPBase provide a mapping of the
original GLEAN gene set to the latest assembly, version 3.1. Extensive
manual curation has been conducted since the GLEAN data was generated,
but the revised transcript sequences have not been mapped back to modify
the gene models. In Ensembl Metazoa the transcript co-ordinates and
visualisations use the original GLEAN data, but the cDNA and protein
sequences represent the manual annotations (which exist for
approximately half of the genes). This situation means that it is not
possible to produce meaningful GTF files, so these are unavailable for
download from Ensembl Metazoa. RNA-seq transcript data from SpBase has
been imported and is displayed as a separate \'predicted transcript\'
track.

Protein domains were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes protein feature
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/protein_features).
