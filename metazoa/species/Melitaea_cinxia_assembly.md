Assembly
--------

The *Melitaea cinxia* genome was assembled by the [Metapopulation
Research
Group](http://www.helsinki.fi/science/metapop/research/mcgenome.html)
(MRG) at the University of Helsinki \[1\]. The *MelCinx1.0* assembly in
Ensembl Metazoa consists of 8,260 scaffolds and a mitochondrial
chromosome. A \"superscaffold\" assembly, with 1,453 superscaffolds
covering 72% of the genome is also [available on the MRG
website](http://www.helsinki.fi/science/metapop/research/mcgenome2_downloads.html).
Both scaffolds and superscaffolds have been assigned to chromosomes, and
mappings are provided by the
[MRG](http://www.helsinki.fi/science/metapop/research/mcgenome2_downloads.html).
