About *Lingula anatina*
-----------------------

***Lingula*** is a genus of brachiopods within the class Lingulata.
*Lingula* is known as \"moule-Ã -queue\" (tailed mussel) in New
Caledonia, \"bec de cane\" (duck bill) along some coasts in the Indian
Ocean, and \"shamisen-gai\" in Japan (for its likeness to the shamisen,
a Japanese lute). *Lingula* is known to have existed possibly since the
Cambrian. Like its relatives, it has two unadorned phosphatic valves and
a long fleshy stalk. *Lingula* lives in burrows in barren sandy coastal
seafloor and feeds by filtering detritus from the water. It can be
detected by a short row of three openings through which it takes in
water (sides) and expels it again (middle). In Thailand, there is
limited *Lingula anatina* fishery, where it is known as *hoi pak ped*.
