Assembly
--------

The *B.malayi* genome was first sequenced at the former [TIGR
institute](http://www.jcvi.org) and a first draft assembly was published
in 2007 (Ghedin E, et. al.). In 2012 a new genome sequencing, assembly
and curation project was conducted on the FR3 strain as a cooperative
effort between [WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org) and the [University
of Pittsburgh](http://www.pitt.edu) as described by [Tracey et al. 2020](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32527783). This sequenced FR3 strain is
available at the [Filiarisis Research Reagent
Center](http://www.filariasiscenter.org).
