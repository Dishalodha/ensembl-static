About *Loa loa*
---------------

*Loa loa*, the African eye worm, is a parasitic nematode and the
causative agent of subcutaneous filariasis in human. Unlike *B.malayi*
it does not contain obligate *Wolbachia* endosymbionts. Its life cycle
contains an insect stage in a *Chrysops* host where it develops into an
infectious larvae stage. Its geographic distribution is mainly Africa
and India.
