**About *Parasteatoda tepidariorum***
-------------------------
*Parasteatoda tepidariorum*, the common house spider (*Parasteatoda 
tepidariorum*) or American house spider, is a spider species of the 
genus Parasteatoda with a cosmopolitan distribution. Common house 
spiders are synanthropic and live in and near human dwellings. Their 
prey mechanism is similar to that of the other cobweb spiders: the 
spider follows disturbances transmitted along the web to entangle and 
then paralyze its prey, which usually consists of household insects 
and other invertebrates.
