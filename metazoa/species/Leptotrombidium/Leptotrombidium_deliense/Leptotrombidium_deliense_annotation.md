[Gene models](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/003/675/905/GCA_003675905.1_ASM367590v1/GCA_003675905.1_ASM367590v1_genomic.gff.gz)
were predicted by University of Liverpool and submitted to NCBI. Ensembl
Genomes imported gene models form NCBI, and later added non-coding RNA
genes using the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html).
The gene set currenty shown (LdelU1.1, July
2019) is an improvement of the initial set, with the addition of
community annotation.
