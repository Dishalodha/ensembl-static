**About *Dendronephthya gigantea***
-------------------------
*Dendronephthya gigantea* belong to the genus of soft corals in the family Nephtheidae. There are over 
250 described species in this genus. They are sometimes kept in aquariums, but are notoriously difficult 
to keep, requiring a near constant supply of small foods such as phytoplankton.
*D. gigantea*, an octocoral also known as carnation coral is a dominant species in the most southerncoastal 
part of Korea. The genome of *D. gigantea* could serve as a resource for evolutionary studies of 
azooxanthellate octocorals in terms of understanding different coping strategies mediating against rapid 
environmental changes in comparison to other published stony coralgenomes (1).
