**About *Octopus bimaculoides***
-------------------------
The California two-spot octopus, often simply called a "bimac", is an 
octopus species native to many parts of the Pacific Ocean including 
the coast of California. One can identify the species by the circular 
blue eyespots on each side of its head. Bimacs usually live to be 
about two years old. They are closely related to Verrill's two-spot 
octopus. In 2015, the genome was sequenced.
