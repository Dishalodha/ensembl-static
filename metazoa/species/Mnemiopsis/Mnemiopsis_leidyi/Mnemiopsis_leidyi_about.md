About *Mnemiopsis leidyi*
-------------------------

*Mnemiopsis leidyi*, the warty comb jelly or sea walnut, is a
ctenophore, originally native to western Atlantic coasts but now found
throughout Europe and Asia, in waters of varying salinity and
temperature. *M. leidyi* has a lobed body and four rows of cilia by
which it moves. It can grow up to 12 cm long and 2.5 cm wide, making
them the largest animals that move by means of cilia. In the absence of
predators (e.g. *Beroe ovata*, another ctenophore) this comb jelly can
drastically deplete fish populations, because it feeds on fish eggs,
larvae and plankton.

The phylogenetic position of *M. leidyi* has been long debated, with
recent studies positioning ctenophores as the sister group to porifera,
placozoa, cnidaria and bilateria. The study of key biological processes,
like regeneration and axial patterning, and its phylogenetic importance
make the comb jelly an important model for evolutionary and
developmental studies.
