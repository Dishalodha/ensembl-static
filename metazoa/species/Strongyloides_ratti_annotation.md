Annotation
----------

The initial gene predictions were made by the [Parasite Genomics group
at the Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/)
as part of the Strongyloididae Nematode Genomes Project (Hunt et al,
2016). An in-house automatic pipeline (based around
[AUGUSTUS](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15215400) plus
[MAKER](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22192575)) was then used to
generate first-pass gene models, and this was followed by a round of
targeted manual curation of selected gene families. Since then,
responsibility for the reference annotation has been passed over to
[WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org), and WormBase curators have made a
number of improvements to the gene structures. The annotation here
corresponds with WormBase release
[WS260](ftp://ftp.wormbase.org/pub/wormbase/releases/WS260/species/s_ratti).
