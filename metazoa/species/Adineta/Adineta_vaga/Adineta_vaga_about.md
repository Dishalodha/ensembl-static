About *Adineta vaga*
--------------------

***Adineta vaga*** is a bdelloid rotifer, a class of rotifers found in
freshwater habitats all over the world. There are over 450 described
species of bdelloid rotifers, distinguished from each other mainly on
the basis of morphology. The main characteristics that distinguish
bdelloids from related groups of rotifers are exclusively
parthenogenetic reproduction and the ability to survive in dry, harsh
environments by entering a state of desiccation-induced dormancy
(anhydrobiosis) at any life stage. They are often referred to as
\"ancient asexuals\" due to their unique asexual history that spans back
to over 25 million years ago through fossil evidence.
