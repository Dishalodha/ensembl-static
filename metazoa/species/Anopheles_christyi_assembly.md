*AchrA1* assembly
-----------------

This assembly was generated using 101 bp paired-end Illumina HiSeq2000
reads generated from two libraries: a 180 bp insert 'fragment' library
and a 1.5 kb 'jump' library. Sequencing template for the fragment and
jump libraries was derived from genomic DNA extracted from a single
individual, which was preserved by freezing at -80C. Native genomic DNA
was used for the fragment library and whole genome amplified DNA was
used for the jump library. Reads were assembled at the Broad Institute
using the ALLPATHS LG algorithm, with the Haploidify option enabled to
address high allelic heterozygosity in the template.
