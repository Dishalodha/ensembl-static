Annotation
----------

Genome annotation was undertaken by the
[WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org) group based in part on the high
quality *C. elegans* annotations and guided by the nGASP assessment
project (Coghlan et al, 2008). Since then, many gene structures have
been improved manually by WormBase curators. The annotation here
corresponds with WormBase
[WS279](https://downloads.wormbase.org/releases/WS279/species/c_remanei).
