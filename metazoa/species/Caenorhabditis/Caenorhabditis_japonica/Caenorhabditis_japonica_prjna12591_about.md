About *Caenorhabditis japonica*
-------------------------------

*Caenorhabditis japonica* is a small, free-living roundworm which
appears to be closely-associated with shield, or stink, bugs.
Frequently, these insects can be found on cabbage plants and the worms
have been reported feeding in the bug\'s nest on dead eggs and adult
bugs. *C. japonica* has only been isolated on the Japanese islands of
Saga and Shikoku. The biology of *C. japonica* is similar to that of
[*C. elegans*](/Caenorhabditis_elegans) with the exception that *C.
japonica* has both male and female adults.

*C. japonica* was first described by Kiontke, Hironaka and Sudhaus in
2002 (Kiontke & Sudhaus, 2006). The sequenced strain DF5081 was derived
from a wild isolate DF5080, isolated from a dead shield bug
(*Parastrachia japonensis*) in Takeo, Japan by Toyoshi Yoshiga. The wild
isolate was inbred for 20 generations in the lab of David Fitch by
transferral of a single plugged gravid female per generation.
