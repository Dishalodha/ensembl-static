Genome Sequencing and Annotation
--------------------------------

The *C. japonica* genome has been sequenced by the the [Genome Institue
at Washington
University](http://genome.wustl.edu "Genome Institute at Washington University")
as part of a larger NHGRI funded [Roundworm Genome
Sequencing](http://www.genome.gov/11007952) project to expand the
Caenorhabditis clade. The genome is approximately 107 Mb in size,
similar to that of the model Rhabditid *C. elegans*.
