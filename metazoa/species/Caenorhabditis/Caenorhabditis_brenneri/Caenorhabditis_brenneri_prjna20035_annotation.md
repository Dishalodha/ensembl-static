Annotation
----------

Genome annotation was initially undertaken by the
[WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org) group based in part on the high
quality *C. elegans* annotations and guided by the nGASP assessment
project (Coghlan et al, 2008). Since then, many gene structures have
been manually revised by WormBase curators. The annotation shown here
corresponds with WormBase
[WS279](https://downloads.wormbase.org/releases/WS279/species/c_brenneri).
