About *Caenorhabditis brenneri*
-------------------------------

*Caenorhabditis brenneri* is a small, free-living round worm found in
decaying plant material throughout the tropics. The worms feed on the
bacteria and other microorganisms associated with plant decay. The
biology of *C. brenneri* is similar to that of [*C.
elegans*](/Caenorhabditis_elegans) with a short generation time through
four larval stages into an adult. *C.brenneri* has both male and female
adults, unlike the hermaphroditic species such as *C. elegans* and *C.
briggsae*.

*C. brenneri* was previously known as *Caenorhabditis* n. sp. 4 or
PB2801 prior to the type description and renaming in 2007 (Sudhaus &
Kiontke). The sequenced strain PB2801 was derived from a wild isolate
LKC28, isolated by Hernan Ruiz from the roots of Liriope
(Convallariaceae) in 2003, grown in a Costa Rican nursery. The wild
isolate was inbred for 20 generations in the lab of Scott Baird by
transferral of a single gravid female per generation.
