Assembly
--------

The *C. brenneri* genome was sequenced by the The Caenorhabditis brenneri Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, [Genome Institute at Washington University](http://genome.wustl.edu "Genome Institute at Washington University")
as part of a larger NHGRI funded [Roundworm Genome
Sequencing](https://www.genome.gov/11007952/roundworm-genome-sequencing) project to expand the Caenorhabditis clade. The genome is approximately 115 Mb in size, some 15% larger than that of the model Rhabditid *C. elegans*. The assembly
was performed using PCAP.
