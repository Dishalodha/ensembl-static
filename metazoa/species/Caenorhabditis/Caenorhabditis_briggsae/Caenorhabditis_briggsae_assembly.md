Assembly
--------

Sequencing of cosmids was initiated during the *C. elegans* project but
the majority of the sequence (approx. 90%) was derived from whole genome
shotgun data from the AF16 strain.

The version of the *C. briggsae* genome sequence in Ensembl Metazoa
(CB4) was produced by the University of Maryland in September 2010.
Around 170 AF16/HK104 advanced-intercross recombinant inbred lines were
successfully genotyped at about 1000 single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) markers. The resulting data were used to estimate high-density
genetic maps. Sequences were assembled by combining the physical
positions (based on the original CB25 assembly: Stein et al, 2003) and
genetic positions of the SNPs to inform the process of ordering and
orienting the CB25 supercontigs into new chromosome assemblies. Detailed
methods are presented in Ross et al, 2011.
