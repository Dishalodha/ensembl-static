About *Caenorhabditis briggsae*
-------------------------------

*Caenorhabditis briggsae* is a small, free-living roundworm found in
decaying plant material especially compost and mushroom beds in
temperate regions throughout the world. The worms feed on the bacteria
and other microorganisms associated with plant decay. The biology of *C.
briggsae* is similar to that of *[C. elegans](/Caenorhabditis_elegans)*,
with a short generation time through four larval stages into an adult.
*C. briggsae* is hermaphroditic like *C. elegans* and distinct from the
other sequenced worms which have both male and female adult animals. *C.
briggsae* is often found at the same site as both *C. elegans* and *C.
remanei*. *C. briggsae* is frequently found associated with snails that
are presumed to transport worms, especially the dormant dauer stage,
from one location to another.
