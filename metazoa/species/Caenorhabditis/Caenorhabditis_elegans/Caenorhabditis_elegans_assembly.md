Assembly
--------

*C. elegans* was the first multicellular organism to be sequenced, in a
collaboration between the [The Genome Institute at Washington
University](http://genome.wustl.edu/) and [The Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk). An essentially complete *C.
elegans* sequence was published in Science in December 1998, and
although the last remaining gap in the sequence was closed in October
2002, the genome sequence and annotation continue to be actively curated
by WormBase. The assembly here is **WBcel235**, which corresponds with
WormBase [WS279](https://downloads.wormbase.org/releases/WS279/species/c_elegans/PRJNA13758/).
