**About *Homarus americanus***
-------------------------
The American lobster (*Homarus americanus*) is a species of lobster
found on the Atlantic coast of North America, chiefly from Labrador to
New Jersey. It is also known as Atlantic lobster, Canadian lobster,
true lobster, northern lobster, Canadian Reds, or Maine lobster. It
can reach a body length of 64 cm (25 in), and a mass of over 20
kilograms (44 lb), making it not only the heaviest crustacean in the
world, but also the heaviest of all living arthropod species. Its
closest relative is the European lobster Homarus gammarus, which can
be distinguished by its coloration and the lack of spines on the
underside of the rostrum. American lobsters are usually bluish green
to brown with red spines, but several color variations have been
observed.
