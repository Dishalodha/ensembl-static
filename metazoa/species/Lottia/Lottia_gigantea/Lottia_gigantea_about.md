About *Lottia gigantea*
-----------------------

*Lottia gigantea*, the owl limpet, is a sea snail that is found along
rocky inter-tidal regions of the Californian coast. Mature limpets are
territorial, often returning to the same location on the rock (the
\"home scar\"), to which the shape of the shell becomes extremely
well-fitted. Underlying this territoriality is the cultivation of an
algal film, across an area proportional to the size of the limpet. Owl
limpets defend their \"gardens\" against intruding owl limpets and other
species, using a range of tactics including brute force shoving and
pinching the intruder\'s soft-body between shell and rock \[1\].

*L. gigantea* has many characteristics that are representative of
molluscs and, more generally, lophotrochozoans, and its genome was
sequenced alongside two annelids ([Capitella
teleta](/Capitella_teleta/Info) and [Helobdella
robusta](/Helobdella_robusta/Info)) to provide insight into metazoan
evolution \[2\]. The genomic data also promotes the use of this species
as a model organism for studies of evolutionary development, ecology,
and conservation.
