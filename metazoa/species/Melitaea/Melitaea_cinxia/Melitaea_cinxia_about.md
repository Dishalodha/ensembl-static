About *Melitaea cinxia*
-----------------------

*Melitaea cinxia*, the Glanville Fritillary, is a member of the
Nymphalidae, the largest butterfly family. Named after a 17th century
English lepidopterist, [Lady Eleanor
Glanville](http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/opinion/blogs/lady-eleanor-and-her-elusive-butterfly/11106908.blog),
its range [in the
UK](http://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/species.php?species=cinxia) is now
restricted to the Isle of Wight, and although distributed widely across
Europe, North Africa and Asia, populations are reportedly in decline.
The spatially separated *M. cinxia* populations in the Åland Islands,
Finland, have been used to study the ecological, genetic and
evolutionary consequences of habitat fragmentation.
