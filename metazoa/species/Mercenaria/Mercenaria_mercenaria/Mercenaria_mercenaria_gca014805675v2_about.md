**About *Mercenaria mercenaria***
-------------------------
The hard clam, also known as the round clam, hard-shell clam, or the 
quahog, is an edible marine bivalve mollusk that is native to the 
eastern shores of North America and Central America from Prince Edward 
Island to the Yucatán Peninsula. It is one of many unrelated edible 
bivalves that in the United States are frequently referred to simply 
as clams, as in the expression "clam digging". Older literature 
sources may use the systematic name Venus mercenaria; this species is 
in the family Veneridae, the venus clams.
