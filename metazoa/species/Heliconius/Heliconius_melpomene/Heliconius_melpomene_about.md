About *Heliconius melpomene* {#about-heliconius-melpomene .first}
----------------------------

Within the butterflies, the combined traits of daytime flight and
colour-vision have led to the evolution of complex colour patterns for
both within- and between-species signalling. As long ago as 1862, Henry
W. Bates, reflecting upon observations made during his stay in the
Amazon basin, had shown that colour patterns for butterflies of the
genus Heliconius were similar between species within any one area.
Furthermore, the specific patterns of such Mullerian mimickry, whereby
species share the cost of educating predators about their unpalatable
nature, changes every 100-200 miles. Such characteristics provide
exciting opportunities for genomic studies into the nature of adaptive
variation, the origin of new species, and the genetic basis of complex
traits. The Postman Butterfly, *Heliconius melpomene*, has large long
wings with a red stripe down each forewing. It is poisonous, and has a
geographical distribution from Central to South America. It is the first
of the Heliconius butterflies to have its genome sequenced.
