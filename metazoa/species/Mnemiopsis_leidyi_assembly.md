Assembly
--------

*Mnemiopsis leidyi* was the first published ctenophore genome, and was
sequenced and assembled by the [National Human Genome Research
Institute](http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/mnemiopsis/) (NHGRI) \[1\]. The
assembly was sequenced to 12x coverage using Roche 454 and Illumina
GA-II mate-pair sequencing technology and assembled with the
[Phusion](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/phusion/)
assembler software.
