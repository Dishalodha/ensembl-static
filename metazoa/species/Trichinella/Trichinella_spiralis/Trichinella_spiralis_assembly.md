Genome sequence and annotation
------------------------------

The genome was sequenced by the Genome Institute at Washington Univerity
in St. Louis, with support from the National Human Genome Research
Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NHGRI - NIH). The
sequence, annotated with protein-coding gene predictions provided by the
authors, was submitted to the INSDC in early 2011.
