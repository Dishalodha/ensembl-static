About *Megaselia scalaris*
--------------------------

*Megaselia scalaris* is a scuttle fly of the Phoridae family, also known
as the coffin fly or humpbacked fly \[1\]. Originally from warm
climates, the species is synanthropic and is now found near human
habitations worldwide. These tiny flies are omnivorous in the broadest
sense of the term, eating almost anything, dead or alive, from bacteria
to mammals; and even manage to survive on just blue paint or boot polish
\[2\]. The name \'coffin fly\' derives from their ability to get through
tiny cracks in coffins in order to feed on the corpse, and forensic
evidence based on the presence of *M. scalaris* can be used to infer a
postmortem interval (if sufficient precautions are taken - see
discussion in \[2\]).

Phylogenetically, *M. scalaris* lies between mosquitoes and fruitflies
\[3\], and thus may be useful in dipteran comparative studies. This
species also has potential as a model organism because it is amenable to
manipulation in a laboratory, and has different neurological and
physiological properties to *Drosophila melanogaster*; it may be
particularly suited to studying mechanisms of sex determination \[4\].
