About *Sarcoptes scabiei*
-------------------------

***Sarcoptes scabiei***, the itch mite, is a parasitic arthropod that
burrows into skin and causes scabies. The mite is cosmopolitan, meaning
it can be found in all parts of the world. Humans are not the only
mammals that can become infected. Other mammals, such as wild and
domesticated dogs and cats as well as ungulates, wild boars, bovids,
wombats, koalas, and great apes are affected. The discovery of the itch
mite in 1687 marked scabies as the first disease of humans with a known
cause. The Italian biologist Diacinto Cestoni showed in the 18th century
that scabies is caused by the mite *Sarcoptes scabiei*, variety
*hominis*. The disease produces intense, itchy skin rashes when the
impregnated female tunnels into the stratum corneum of the skin and
deposits eggs in the burrow. The larvae, which hatch in three to 10
days, move about on the skin, moult into a nymphal stage, and then
mature into adult mites. The adult mites live three to four weeks in the
host\'s skin.
