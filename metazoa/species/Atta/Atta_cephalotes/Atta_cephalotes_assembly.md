Assembly
--------

The genome of *Atta cephalotes* was assembled (to a coverage depth of
\~18-20x) using genomic DNA from an alate male ant, collected from a
mature colony in Panama. The sequencing was performed with 454 Titanium
technology, allied with shotgun 8-kbp and 20-kbp paired-end sequencing
datasets \[1\]. Ensembl Metazoa contains the *Attacep1.0(2)* version of
the assembly, which adds the mitochondrial chromosome to the
*Attacep1.0* version.
