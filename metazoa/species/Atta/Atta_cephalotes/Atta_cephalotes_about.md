About *Atta cephalotes*
-----------------------

Leaf-cutter ants, such as *Atta cephalotes*, are among the most
important herbivorous insects in the neotropics. These ants harvest vast
quantities of fresh leaf material, which is used to cultivate a fungus
that serves as the colony\'s primary food source. This obligate
ant-fungus mutualism is one of the few occurrences of farming by
non-humans and likely enabled the formation of their massive colonies.
Leaf-cutter ant colonies display one of the most complex polymorphic
caste systems, with workers ranging from small garden workers to large
soldiers.
