The reference genome for Onchocerca volvulus has been produced by the
[Parasite Genomics team at the Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/).
A combination of deep sequencing and optical mapping was used on
material from a single adult worm from the Republic of Cameroon.
