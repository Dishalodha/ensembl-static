Assembly
--------

The *Lottia gigantea* genome (v1.0, July 2007) was sequenced to 8.9x
coverage, and assembled with the
[JGI](http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Lotgi1/Lotgi1.info.html) software, Jazz.
After quality control, the paired-end reads assembled into 4,469
scaffolds, giving a genome size of approximately 360 Mb.
