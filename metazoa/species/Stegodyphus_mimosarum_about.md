About *Stegodyphus mimosarum*
-----------------------------

*Stegodyphus mimosarum* is commonly known as the African social velvet
spider. Social spiders live in large, communal webs, in which they feed
communally and cooperate in prey capture, web maintenance and brood
care. Social spiders are highly inbred due to within-colony breeding and
a lack of a pre-mating dispersal stage, they are therefore a perfect
system to study inbreeding effects in wild animal populations.
