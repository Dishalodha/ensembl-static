Annotation
----------

Protein-coding and RNA genes, which were annotated with the [NCBI
eukaryotic genome annotation
pipeline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/process/),
were imported from [FlyBase](http://www.flybase.org), release
dpse\_r3.04 (FB2017\_04).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/repeat_features). There
are: 286,876 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 13 Mb (8.5% of the
genome); 32,712 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library),
covering 12 Mb (7.7% of the genome); 181,856 Tandem repeats (TRF)
features, covering 12 Mb (7.7% of the genome).

Protein domains were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes protein feature
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/protein_features).
