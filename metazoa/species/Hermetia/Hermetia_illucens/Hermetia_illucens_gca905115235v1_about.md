**About *Hermetia illucens***
-------------------------
*Hermetia illucens*, the black soldier fly, is a common and widespread 
fly of the family Stratiomyidae.

The larvae and adults are considered neither pests nor vectors. Instead, 
black soldier fly larvae play a similar role to that of redworms as essential 
decomposers in breaking down organic substrates and returning nutrients to the 
soil. The larvae have voracious appetites and can be used for composting household 
food scraps and agricultural waste products. Additionally, black soldier fly larvae 
(BSFL) are an alternative source of protein for aquaculture, animal feed, pet 
food and human nutrition.
