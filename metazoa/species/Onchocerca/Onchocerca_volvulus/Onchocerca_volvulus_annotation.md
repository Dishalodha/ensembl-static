Annotation
----------

The [Berriman lab](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/)
have collaborated with [WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org) to produce
first pass annotation of the genome, using [MAKER](http://www.yandell-lab.org/software/maker.html). WormBase has
since taken on responsibility for the manual curation of the gene set,
and WormBase curators have made numerous improvements to the gene
models. The annotation version shown here corresponds with WormBase
Release [WS279](https://downloads.wormbase.org/releases/WS279/species/o_volvulus).
We welcome feedback from the *Onchocerca* community in order to help
identify and prioritise curation targets. Suggests for curation targets
should be sent to <help@wormbase.org>.
