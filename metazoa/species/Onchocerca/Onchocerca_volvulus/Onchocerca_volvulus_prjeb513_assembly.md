The reference genome for *Onchocerca volvulus* has been produced by the
[Berriman lab](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/) as part of the 50 Helminth Genomes Initiative. A combination of deep sequencing and optical mapping was used on material from a single adult worm from the Republic of Cameroon.
