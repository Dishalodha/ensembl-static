**About *Metaseiulus occidentalis***
-------------------------

The species *Metaseiulus occidentalis* (synonym: "*Galendromus occidentalis*") is a spider mite 
belonging to the genus *Galendromus* (family "Phytoseiidae"). This family includes species that 
feed on thrips and other mite species. Current estimates on species diveristy cite approximately 
2,731 documented species; organized into 90 genera and three subfamilies (Amblyseiinae, 
Phytoseiinae, Typhlodrominae). They are often used as a biological control agent for managing mite 
pests. Because of their usefulness as biological control agents, interest in Phytoseiidae has 
steadily increased over the past century. Public awareness of the biological control potential of 
invertebrates has been growing, though mainly in the US and Europe. Phytoseiids are an important 
natural predator of spider mites (1). When phytoseiid populations decline, spider mites can severely 
damage commercial crops.
