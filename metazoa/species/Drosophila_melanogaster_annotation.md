Annotation
----------

Protein-coding and RNA genes were imported from
[FlyBase](http://www.flybase.org), release dmel\_r6.28 (FB2019\_03).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/repeat_features). There
are: 222,250 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 8 Mb (5.5% of the
genome); 47,752 RepeatMasker features (with a custom library), covering
22 Mb (15.5% of the genome); 41,693 RepeatMasker features (with the
RepBase library), covering 26 Mb (17.8% of the genome); 72,600 Tandem
repeats (TRF) features, covering 6 Mb (4.1% of the genome).

Protein domains were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes protein feature
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/protein_features).
