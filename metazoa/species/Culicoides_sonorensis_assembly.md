Assembly
--------

The genome of *C. sonorensis* is derived from pooled samples of both
male (n=375) and female (n=150) individuals. DNA samples were obtained
from the 'AA' colony originally established in the Kerrville laboratory,
(Texas, USA) and then maintained and hosted in the Pirbright Institute
(Woking, UK) from 1969 without any additional inbreeding. Library
construction and sequencing were performed at the Earlham institute
(Norwich, UK). The genome was sequenced from 200 bp PE and 4.4Kb average
insert MP libraries, using a combination of illumina HiSeq 2000 and 2500
systems at a coverage of \~27X. The present assembly of *C.*
*sonorensis* genome^1^, which has four chromosomes, was generated at
EMBL-EBI (Hinxton, UK). The assembly length of *C.* *sonorensi*s genome
is 189Mb, housed in 7,974 scaffolds has a contig N50 of 30,774 and a
scaffold N50 of 89,077bp. The proportion of assembly gaps or N's was
2.63%. Coverage of repeats 14% and low complexity regions (15.7%) can be
located to 793 repeat regions or 29.7% of the overall genome length.
