About *Bombyx mori*
-------------------

The silkworm, *Bombyx mori*, has been used for silk production for over
5,000 years, and continues to be an economically important species. *B.
mori* is a fully domesticated insect, and due to its ease of culture,
the silkworm has become a model organism in the study of lepidopteran
and arthropod biology \[1,2\].
