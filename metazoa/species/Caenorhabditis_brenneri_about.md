About *Caenorhabditis brenneri*
-------------------------------

*Caenorhabditis brenneri* is a small, free-living round worm found in
decaying plant material throughout the tropics. The worms feed on the
bacteria and other micro-organisms associated with plant decay. The
biology of *C. brenneri* is similar to that of [*C.
elegans*](/Caenorhabditis_elegans) with a short generation time through
four larval stages into an adult. *C.brenneri* has both male and female
adults, unlike the hermaphroditic species such as *C. elegans* and *C.
briggsae*.

*C. brenneri* was previously known as *Caenorhabditis* n. sp. 4 or
PB2801 prior to the type description and renaming in 2007 (Sudhaus &
Kiontke). The sequenced strain PB2801 was derived from a wild isolate
LKC28, isolated by Hernan Ruiz from the roots of Liriope
(Convallariaceae) in 2003, grown in an Costa Rican nursery. The wild
isolate was inbred for 20 generations in the lab of Scott Baird by
transferral of a single gravid female per generation.
