About *Apis mellifera*
----------------------

*Apis mellifera*, the European (or western) honey bee, is native to
western Asia, Europe and Africa, but can now be found all around the
world. The size of *A. mellifera* varies between 10-20mm and depends on
their role (worker bees are 10-15mm long, queens 18-20mm and drones
15-17mm). A bee\'s food intake dictates its future role in the hive, and
its life span: workers live 2-4 weeks in the summer or 11 months over
the winter, drones 4-8 weeks, and queens 2-5 years.

*Apis mellifera* is a model species for social behaviour, and has an
essential ecological role as a pollinator.
