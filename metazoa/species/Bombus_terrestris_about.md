*Bombus terrestris*, the buff-tailed bumblebee, is one of the most
numerous bumblebee species in Europe. It is one of the main species used
in greenhouse pollination, and so can be found in many countries and
areas where it is not native, such as Tasmania. Moreover, it is a
eusocial insect with an overlap of generations, a division of labor, and
cooperative brood care. The queen is monandrous which means she mates
with only one male. *B. terrestris* workers learn flower colours and
forage efficiently.
