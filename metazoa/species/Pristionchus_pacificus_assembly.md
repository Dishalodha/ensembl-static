*P. pacificus*, California strain, was sequenced by the [Genome
Institute at Washington University](http://genome.wustl.edu/) (St.
Louis) in collaboration with the Max-Planck Institute. The genome is
approximately 160 Mb in size, somewhat larger than other Rhabditid
species, but with a similar karyotype.
