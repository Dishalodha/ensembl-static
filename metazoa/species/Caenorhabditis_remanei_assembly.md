Assembly
--------

The *C. remanei* genome has been sequenced by the [Genome Institute at
Washington University](http://genome.wustl.edu/) as part of a larger
NHGRI funded [Roundworm Genome
Sequencing](http://www.genome.gov/11007952) project to expand the
Caenorhabditis clade. The genome is approximately 450 Mb in size,
considerably larger than that of the model Rhabditid *C. elegans*. The
assembly has been performed using PCAP.
