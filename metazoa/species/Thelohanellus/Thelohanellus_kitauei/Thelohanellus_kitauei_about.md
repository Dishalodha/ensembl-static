*Thelohanellus kitauei* is a myxosporean, a highly derived class of
Cnidaria \[1\]. The Myxosporea are a class of microscopic parasites,
belonging to the Myxozoa. They have a complex life cycle which comprises
vegetative forms in two hosts, an aquatic invertebrate (generally an
annelid) and an ectothermic vertebrate, usually a fish. Each host
releases a different type of spore. The two forms of spore are so
different that until recently they were treated as belonging to
different classes within the Myxozoa.
