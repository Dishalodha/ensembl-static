**About *Aphidius gifuensis***
-------------------------

*Aphidius gifuensis* is a small wasp belonging to the Hymenopteran genus Aphidius (family "Braconidae"). 
This genus includes many species that provide biological pest control of aphids via endoparasitism. 
*A. gifuensis* (subfamily Aphidiinae) represents one of the most important natural enemies of aphids 
(Hemiptera) which have impacts across agricultural crops, greenhouses, and home gardens. Species with 
Aphidius are naturally abundant, having a cosmopolitan distribution, imparting significant control effects 
across many different pest species (1). After egg laying by the adult wasp, wasp larvae hatch and 
feed on the inside of an aphid. As the larvae mature, the hosts die and become slightly enlarged or 
mummified. Complete metamorphosis occurs within the host.
