Assembly
--------

The *Tetranychus urticae* genome (London strain) was Sanger-sequenced to
8.05x coverage, using embryos to avoid plant and microbial
contamination. The assembly consists of 640 scaffolds, with a genome
size of approximately 90 Mb, representing a relatively small genome for
a chelicerate (or, indeed, any metazoan).
