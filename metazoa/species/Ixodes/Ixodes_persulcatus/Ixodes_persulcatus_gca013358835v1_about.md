About *Ixodes persulcatus*
-------------------------

_Ixodes persulcatus_, the *taiga tick*, is a species of hard-bodied tick distributed from Europe through central and northern Asia to the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China and Japan. The sexual dimorphism of the species is marked, the male being much smaller than the female. Hosts include wild and domestic ungulates, man, dog, rabbit, and other small mammals including the dormouse, Amur hedgehog, and occasionally birds.

_Ixodes persulcatus_ ticks transmit *Lyme disease*, *relapsing fever* (_Borrelia miyamotoi_), *babesiosis*, and *Siberian (TBEV-Sib)* and *Far Eastern (TBEV-FE)* *tick-borne encephalitis*, and probably human granulocytic anaplasmosis as well.
