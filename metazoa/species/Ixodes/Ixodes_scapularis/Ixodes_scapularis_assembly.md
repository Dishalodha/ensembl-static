The *Ixodes scapularis* Wikel strain genome sequence is a joint effort
between the [Broad Institute](http://www.broad.mit.edu/) and the [J.
Craig Venter Institute (JCVI)](http://www.jcvi.org). Assembly of the
estimated 4x shotgun coverage was performed at the JCVI. The assembly
presented here (IscaW1, 2008) consists of 369,492 supercontigs,
totalling 1,76 Gigabases, with a supercontig N50 size of 72 Kb.
