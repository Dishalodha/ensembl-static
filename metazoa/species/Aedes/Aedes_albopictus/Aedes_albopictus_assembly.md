*AaloF1* assembly
-----------------

The *Aedes albopictus Foshan* strain genome sequence is described in the
publication [Genome sequence of the Asian Tiger mosquito, Aedes
albopictus, reveals insights into its biology, genetics, and
evolution](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/44/E5907.full). DNA was
isolated from a single *Ae. albopictus* pupa of a 9th generation
iso-female line of the *Foshan* strain and subjected to whole genome
amplification. An assembly of 237x coverage was generated using
SOAPdenovo, SSPACE and Gapcloser. The assembly presented here (*AaloF1*,
November 2015) totals 1.9 Gb of an estimated 2.9 Gbp total genome
length, with a contig N50 of 195.5 Kb.
