About *Aedes aegypti*
---------------------

*Aedes aegypti* exists in at least two forms (considered either
subspecies or separate species according to different authors), namely
*Ae. aegypti formosus* (the original wild type found in Africa) and *Ae.
aegypti aegypti* (the worldwide urban form). The yellow fever mosquito,
*Ae. aegypti aegypti*, has a worldwide distribution in the tropics and
subtropics where it is the main vector of both dengue and yellow fever
viruses. It can also transmit chikungunya and Zika viruses.
