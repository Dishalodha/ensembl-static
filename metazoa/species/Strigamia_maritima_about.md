About *Strigamia maritima*
--------------------------

*Strigamia maritima* is a coastal European centipede of the
Geophilimorph order. Like all centipedes, it is predatory, using
venomous forcipules (legs adapted into pincers) to eat worms and small
marine invertebrates that have been washed onshore. *S. maritima* is an
eyeless species, using antennae to hunt, and specimens have around 49
pairs of legs; the exact number of segments depends on both genetic and
environmental factors, and varies on a latitudinal cline \[1\]. The
variablility in segment number (some centipede species always have the
same number of segments) makes *S. maritima* a useful model for
arthropod development \[2, 3\].

*S. maritima* is the first myriapod genome to be sequenced, which makes
it an interesting species in phylogenetic terms. The placement of
myriapods (centipedes, millipedes and similar species) on the tree of
life has been a subject of some debate, but a recent study \[4\] has
myriapods as a sister group to pancrustacea (insects and crustaceans),
with chelicerates (such as ticks and spiders) as an outgroup. Centipedes
have a simple, possibly ancestral, bodyplan, so the genome sequence of
*S. maritima* is an important reference for arthropod comparative
genomics.
