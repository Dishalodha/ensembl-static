*AfunF3* assembly
-----------------

The *AfunF3* assembly is described in the paper [\'A chromosome-scale
assembly of the major African malaria vector Anopheles
funestus\'](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz063/5510289),
Ghurye et. al., GigaScience, Volume 8, Issue 6, June 2019, giz063,
<https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giz063>. The *AfunF3* assembly
replaces the *AfunF1* assembly for the FUMOZ strain.

*AfunF3* was generated using 240x coverage of long-read single-molecule
sequencing for contigging, combined with 100x coverage of short-read
Hi-C data for chromosome scaffolding. The assembled contigs total 446
Mbp of sequence and contain substantial duplication due to alternative
alleles present in the sequenced pool of mosquitos from the *FUMOZ*
colony. Using alignment and depth-of-coverage information, these contigs
were deduplicated to a 211 Mbp.
