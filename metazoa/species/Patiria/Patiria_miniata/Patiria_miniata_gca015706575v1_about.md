**About *Patiria miniata***
-------------------------
*Patiria miniata*, the bat star (*Patiria miniata*), sea bat, webbed
star, or broad-disk star, is a species of sea star in the family
Asterinidae. It typically has five arms, with the center disk of the
animal being much wider than the stubby arms are in length. Although
the bat star usually has five arms, it sometimes has as many as nine.
Bat stars occur in many colors, including green, purple, red, orange,
yellow and brown, either mottled or solid. The bat star gets its name
from the webbing between its arms, which is said to resemble a bat's
wings.
