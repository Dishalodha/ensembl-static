### Annotation

MAKER was used to carry out ab-initio, evidence (RNAseq) and
homology-based gene prediction. Over 43K complete and partial
protein-encoding genes were obtained, with mean size 1,097bp.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: 479122 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 39 Mb (14.3% of the
genome); 135815 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat library), covering
29 Mb (10.8% of the genome); 2701 RepeatMasker features (with the
RepBase library), covering 1 Mb (0.2% of the genome); 150729 Tandem
repeats (TRF) features, covering 28 Mb (10.3% of the genome).
