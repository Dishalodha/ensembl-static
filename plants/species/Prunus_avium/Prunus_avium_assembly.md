### Assembly

Assembly PAV\_r1.0 was obtained by combining a paired-end library
(insert size: 500 bp), four mate-pair libraries (insert sizes of 2, 5,
10, and 15 kb) and two assemblers (SOAPdenovo2 r240 and Platanus
v1.2.1). The total length of the assembled sequences was 272.4 Mb,
consisting of 10,148 scaffold sequences with an N50 length of 219.6 kb.
The sequences covered 77.8% of the genome size (352.9 Mb) estimated by
k-mer analysis, and included \>96.0% of the core eukaryotic genes (BUSCO
v1.1b). A high-density consensus map with 2,382 loci was constructed.
Comparing the genetic maps of sweet cherry and peach (Prunus persica)
revealed high synteny between them. Scaffolds were integrated into
pseudo-molecules using map and synteny-based strategies.
