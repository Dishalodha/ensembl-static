### Assembly

The IWGSC RefSeq v1.0, comprised of Illumina short sequence reads
assembled with NRGene's DeNovoMAGIC software, produced scaffolds
totaling 14.5Gb with a chromosomal scaffold/superscaffold N50 of 22.8
Mb.\
Scaffolds have been assigned to chromosomal locations using POPSEQ data
and a HiC map. Over 99% of chromosome survey contigs map to the new
assembly.
