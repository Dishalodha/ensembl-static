### Annotation

The IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 annotation includes gene models generated by
integrating predictions made by INRA-GDEC using Triannot and PGSB using
their customised pipeline (previously MIPS pipeline). The integration
was undertaken by the Earlham institute (EI), who have also added UTRs
to the gene models where supporting data are available. Gene models have
been assigned to high confidence (HC) or low confidence (LC) classes
based on completeness, similarity to genes represented in protein and
DNA databases and repeat content. The automated assignment of functional
annotation to genes has been generated by PGSB based on AHRD
parameters.\
The annotation includes 110,790 high confidence genes, 158,793 low
confidence genes and 13,044 long coding RNAs.\
98,270 high confidence genes from the TGACv1 annotation were aligned to
the assembly using
[Exonerate](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/vertebrate-genomics/software/exonerate).
For each gene up to 3 alignments are displayed, compromising 196,243
alignments of which 90,686 are protein coding.
