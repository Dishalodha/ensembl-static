### Annotation
Gene annotation was performed using the MAKER pipeline (v3.01.02) with 34.1% of the fonio genome masked as repetitive. Transcript sequences of CM05836 from flag leaves, grains, panicles, and whole above-ground seedlings in combination with protein sequences of publicly available plant genomes were used to annotate the CM05836 assembly. This resulted in the annotation of 59,844 protein-coding genes (57,023 on 18 pseudomolecules and 2821 on unanchored chromosome) with an average length of 2.5â€‰kb and an average exon number of 4.6. The analysis of the four CM05836 RNA-seq samples showed that 44,542 protein coding genes (74.3%) were expressed (>0.5 transcripts per million), which is comparable to the annotation of the bread wheat genome.
