### Variation

768664 markers from the 820K Axiom SNP array from CerealsDB were aligned
to the assembly.\
This was done by CerealsDB\[1\] using Blast with a cutoff of 1e-05. The
top three hits were parsed and compared to CerealsDB genetic map data.
In cases where two or more of the top three hits had an identical score,
the hit agreed with the genetic map was selected. In cases of no genetic
map information for a particular SNP then the top hit was selected.
