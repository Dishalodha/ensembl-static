### Assembly

The genome was assembled by
[JGI](https://www.cottongen.org/analysis/50), using a modified version
of Arachne to assemble 80,765,952 sequence reads, integrating linear
(15x genome coverage) and paired (3.1x genome coverage) Roche 454
libraries corrected using 41.9 Gb Illumina sequence, with 1.54x
paired-end Sanger sequences from two subclone, six fosmid and two BAC
libraries. Cotton genetic and physical maps, and *Vitis vinifera * and
***Theobroma cacao*** synteny were used to identify 51 joins across 64
scaffolds to form the 13 chromosomes. The remaining scaffolds were
screened for contamination to produce a final assembly of 1,033
scaffolds (19,735 contigs) and 761.4 Mbp \[1\]\[2\].
