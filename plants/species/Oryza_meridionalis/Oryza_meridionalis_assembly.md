### Assembly

The genome sequence was generated and assembled by the [Arizona Genomics
Institute (AGI)](https://www.genome.arizona.edu/) using accession W2112.
Illumina reads of different library sizes were assembled with Abyss;
scaffolds were constructed with SSPACE, and gaps were closed with
GapFiller. The estimated coverage from the WGS was 166x. Total sequence
length 335,668,232 bp; Number of contigs 62,778; Contig N50: 9,149 bp.

The current assembly was updated from v1 to v1.3 (which mainly consisted
in reducing gap size, breaking down or excluding contigs, and removing
potential contaminating sequences, e.g. contigs bearing similarity to
mitochondrial sequences); MAKER-P annotations were also updated.
