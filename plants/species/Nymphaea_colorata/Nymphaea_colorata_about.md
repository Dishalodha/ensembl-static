About *Nymphaea colorata*
-------------------------

Blue-petal water lilly *Nymphaea colorata* is a diploid (2n=28) with a relatively small genome size (approximately 400 Mb) popular in breeding programs. As other water lily species, it has large, showy flowers. Its flowers have limited differentiation in perianths (outer floral organs), possess both male and female organs and have diverse scents and colours, similar to many mesangiosperms (core angiosperms, including eudicots, monocots, and magnoliids). Water lilies belong to the angiosperm order Nymphaeales, which together with Amborellales and Austrobaileyales form the so-called ANA-grade of angiosperms, which represent the earliest lineages to diverge from the lineage leading to the extant mesangiosperms. This project was performed at Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University.
