### Assembly

Total DNA was extracted from young leaves of isolate Beijing-Zhang1983. A total of 34 SMRT cells and 49.8 Gb data composed of 5.5M reads were sequenced on PacBio RSII. The contig-level assembly was performed on full PacBio long reads using Canu v.1.3. The draft assembly was first polished using Arrow and then with Illumina short reads and Pilon. The paired-end reads from Hi-C were uniquely mapped onto the draft assembly contigs, which were grouped into chromosomes and scaffolded using the software Lachesis. The final assembly contains 1,429 contigs (contig N50 of 2.1 Mb) and total length of 409 Mb with 804 scaffolds, 770 of which were anchored onto 14 pseudo-chromosomes. Assembly quality was measured using BUSCO v.3.0, yielding a genome completeness of 94.4%. Genomic collinearity analysis unveiled evidence of a whole-genome duplication event.
