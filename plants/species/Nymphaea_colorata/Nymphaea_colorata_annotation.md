### Annotation

For Illumina transcriptome sequencing several organs and tissues were sampled, including mature leaf, mature leafstalk, juvenile flower, juvenile leaf, juvenile leafstalk, carpel, stamen, sepal, petal and root. Genscan and Augustus were used to carry out de novo predictions with gene model parameters trained from Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, gene models were de novo predicted using MAKER. We then evaluated the genes by comparing MAKER results with the corresponding transcript evidence to select gene models that were the most consistent on the basis of an AED metric.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There are: 708,889 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 21 Mb (5.1% of the genome); 176,765 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat library), covering 51 Mb (12.5% of the genome); 15,309 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library), covering 3 Mb (0.6% of the genome); 216,157 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 18 Mb (4.5% of the genome).
