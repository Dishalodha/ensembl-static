### Assembly

An orange, doubled-haploid, Nantes-type carrot (DH1) was used for genome
sequencing by the [United States Department of
Agriculture](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27158781). BAC end
sequences were used and a newly developed linkage map with 2,075 markers
to correct 135 scaffolds with one or more chimeric regions.

The resulting v2.0 assembly spans 421.5 Mb and contains 4,907 scaffolds
(N50 of 12.7 Mb), accounting for approximately 90% of the estimated
genome size. The scaftig N50 of 31.2 kb is similar to those of other
high-quality genome assemblies such as
[potato](http://Solanum%20tuberosum). About 86% (362 Mb) of the
assembled genome is included in only 60 super-scaffolds anchored to the
nine pseudomolecules. The longest superscaffold spans 30.2 Mb, 85% of
chromosome 4.
