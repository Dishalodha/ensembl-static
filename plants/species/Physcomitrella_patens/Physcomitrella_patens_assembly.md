### Assembly

The initial draft genome V1 of ecotype Gransden 2004 was published in
2007 and was distributed over ca. 2000 scaffolds. The genome was
re-assembled and published in 2018 as V3. The V3 assembly contains 472
Mb in 27 pseudo-chromosomes (1.3% gaps), and 3.9 Mb in 330 unordered
nuclear scaffolds. Scaffolds and their associated gene models that were
identified as contaminants were removed in three rounds, most recently
2018. The plastid and mitochondrial genome were re-assembled and
annotated with the same release, correcting some errors.
