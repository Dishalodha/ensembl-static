About *Triticum dicoccoides*
----------------------------

Emmer wheat or hulled wheat is a type of awned wheat. Emmer is a
tetraploid (2n = 4x = 28 chromosomes).The domesticated types are
*Triticum turgidum* subsp. dicoccum and *Triticum turgidum* conv. durum.
The wild plant is called *Triticum turgidum* subsp. dicoccoides. The
principal difference between the wild and the domestic is that the
ripened seed head of the wild plant shatters and scatters the seed onto
the ground, while in the domesticated emmer the seed head remains
intact, thus making it easier for humans to harvest the grain. Along
with einkorn wheat, emmer was one of the first crops domesticated in the
Near East. It was widely cultivated in the ancient world, but is now a
relict crop in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. Emmer is
considered a type of farro food especially in Italy.
