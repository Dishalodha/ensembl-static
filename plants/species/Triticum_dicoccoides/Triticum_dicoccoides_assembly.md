### Assembly

Wild emmer accession "Zavitan" was chosen for this genome assembly to
leverage the genetic data already collected for this line by the [WEWseq
Consortium.](https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28684525) The WEW
reference genome, constructed by whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing
of various insert-size libraries, produced contigs with an N50 of 57,378
base pairs (bp) and scaffolds with an N50 of 6,955,166 bp. The scaffolds
were validated with genetic data and combined with three-dimensional
(3D) chromosome conformation capture sequencing (HiC) data, enabling
construction of chromosome-scale assemblies (pseudomolecules). The
resulting 10.5-Gb genome assembly is composed of 14 pseudomolecule
sequences representing the 14 chromosomes of WEW (10.1 Gb) and one group
of unassigned scaffolds (0.4 Gb). The gaps between scaffolds, estimated
to represent \~1.5 Gb of the genome, are likely the result of
technically difficult-to-sequence or difficult-to-assemble regions.
