About *Chondrus crispus*
------------------------

**Chondrus crispus**,  commonly called Irish moss or carrageen moss, 
is a common edible red seaweed
which grows abundantly along the rocky parts of the Atlantic coast of
Europe and North America. In its fresh condition this protist algae is soft
and cartilaginous, varying in color from a greenish-yellow, through red,
to a dark purple or purplish-brown. The principal constituent is a
mucilaginous body, made of the polysaccharide carrageenan, which
constitutes 55% of its weight. The organism also consists of nearly 10%
protein and about 15% mineral matter, and is rich in iodine and sulfur.
When softened in water it has a sea-like odour and because of the
abundant cell wall polysaccharides it will form a jelly when boiled,
containing from 20 to 100 times its weight of water.
