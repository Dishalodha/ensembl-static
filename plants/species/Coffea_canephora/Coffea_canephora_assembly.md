### Assembly

The sequenced genotype (2n=22, 1C=710 Mb) is a doubled-haploid plant
(accession DH200-94) produced by IRD from the clone IF200. A total of
54.4 million Roche 454 single and mate-pair reads and 143,605 Sanger
bacterial artificial chromosome--end reads were generated, achieving 30x
coverage. Additional Illumina sequencing data (60x) were used to improve
the assembly. The resulting assembly consists of 25,216 contigs and
13,345 scaffolds with a total length of 568.6 Mb. Eighty percent of the
assembly is in 635 scaffolds, and the scaffold N50 is 1.26 Mb. A
high-density genetic map comprising 64% of the assembly and 86% of the
annotated genes was anchored to 11 chromosomes.
