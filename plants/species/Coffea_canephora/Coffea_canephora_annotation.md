### Annotation

A total of 25,574 protein-coding genes were annotated using various
sources of evidence (cDNAs, RNA-Seq, protein alignments, and ab initio
predictions) that were combined into gene models.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 209982696 - Repeats content: 36.9292%
