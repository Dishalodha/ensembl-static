About *Lupinus angustifolius*
-----------------------------

Lupins are grain legumes that form an integral part of sustainable
farming systems and have been an important part of the human diet for
thousands of years. Planted in rotation with cereal crops, lupins reduce
the need for nitrogenous fertiliser, provide valuable disease breaks and
boost cereal yields. Lupins thrive on low-nutrient soils due to their
ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis with beneficial
bacteria and efficiently take up phosphorus from soils. Consequently,
they are effective ecological pioneers and able to colonise extremely
impoverished soils such as coastal sand dunes and new lava soils set
down by recently erupted volcanoes. Narrow-leafed lupin (*Lupinus
angustifolius*) is gaining popularity as a health food, which is high in
protein and dietary fibre but low in starch and gluten-free.
