### Assembly

The genomic sequence within this version of Ensembl includes 33,459
scaffolds (\>200 bp) with an N50 of 850 kb that was assembled at
[NRC-Saskatoon](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4097860) using a hybrid
approach from Illumina, Roche 454 and Sanger sequence data. The assembly
has been orientated and assigned to the nine pseudochromosomes using
dense genotype-by-sequencing genetic maps.
