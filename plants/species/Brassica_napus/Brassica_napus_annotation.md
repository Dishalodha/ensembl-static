### Annotation

A total of 101,040 gene models were estimated from 35.5 Gb of RNA-seq
data in combination with *ab initio* gene prediction, protein and EST
alignments, and transposon masking [by
GSC](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/25146293). Of these, 91,167 were
confirmed by matches with *B. rapa* and/or *B. oleracea* predicted
proteomes.
