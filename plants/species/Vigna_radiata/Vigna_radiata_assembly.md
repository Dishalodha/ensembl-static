### Assembly

The pure line VC1973A of *Vigna radiata* var. radiata was used for
genome sequencing by [Seoul National
University](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4241982). Paired-end 180-bp
and 500-bp libraries, and mate-pair 5-, 10- and 40-kb libraries were
prepared and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq2000. These libraries provided a
physical coverage of 320-fold of the estimated genome size. In addition,
long reads providing \~ 5-fold genome coverage were produced by
sequencing using GS FLX+. The Illumina reads were assembled using
ALLPATHS-LG, producing 2,800 scaffolds with an N50 length of 1,507 kb.
The total length of the scaffolds was \~ 431 Mb. The GS FLX+ reads were
assembled using Newbler 2.5.3 into 180,372 contigs. A total of 144,213
of the GS FLX+ contigs were consistent with the scaffolds from
ALLPATHS-LG. The non-matched GS FLX+ contigs were divided into 5-kb
pseudo-mate-pair reads and assembled using ALLPATHS-LG to improve the
quality of the assembly, resulting in 2,748 scaffolds with an N50 length
of 1.52 Mb. The total length of the produced scaffolds was 431 Mb,
representing 80% of the genome size of 543 Mb estimated from 25-bases
long k-mer frequency distribution.
