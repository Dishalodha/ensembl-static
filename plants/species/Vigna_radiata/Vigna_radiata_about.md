About *Vigna radiata*
---------------------

*Vigna radiata* \[L.\] R. Wilczek (mungbean or green gram) is an ancient
legume crop that was domesticated in India some 3.5 million years ago.
Mungbean is a versatile crop that only takes 60-65 days to harvest and
one of the major edible pulse crops of India, China other countries in
South and South East-Asia. It is also cultivated and eaten in Southern
Europe, the Southern USA and in semi-arid countries in Africa e.g.
Kenya. The mature seeds provide an invaluable source of digestible
protein, fibre, B vitamins and minerals, particularly iron, potassium,
magnesium and zinc for humans (including infant supplements) in places
where meat is lacking or where the population is mostly vegetarian.
Mungbean is not only grown for seeds but also as forage (fodder for
cattle). Mungbean is a self-pollinated diploid (2n = 22) plant with the
estimated genome size of [494](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4756517)
to [579](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4241982) Mb depending on the
analysed genotype.
