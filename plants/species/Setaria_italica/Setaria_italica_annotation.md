### Annotation

Protein-coding genes were predicted using [the standard JGI plant gene
annotation pipeline](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22580951). They
used ESTs and homologous peptides from Arabidopsis, Brachypodium, rice
and sorghum, mapped with BLAT alignments of PASA and EXONERATE, with
GenomeScan, FGENESH+ and FGENESH\_EST. BACs and fosmids were annotated
using AUGUSTUS with maize parameters to predict gene models, which were
compared to GenBank, TAIR and IRGSP/RAP proteins and manually inspected.
Gene models were validated with RNA-seq data.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 165850081 - Repeats content: 40.9%
