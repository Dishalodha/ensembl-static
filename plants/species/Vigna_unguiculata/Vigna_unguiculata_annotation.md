### Annotation
The assembled genome was annotated using de novo
gene prediction and transcript evidence based on cowpea
ESTs and RNA-seq data from leaf,
stem, root, flower and seed tissue, and protein sequences of Arabidopsis, common
bean, soybean, Medicago, poplar, rice and grape. In total, 29 773 protein-coding
loci were annotated, along with 12 514 alternatively spliced
transcripts. Most (95.9%) of the 1440 expected plant genes
in BUSCO v3 were identified in the
cowpea gene set, indicating completeness of genome
assembly and annotation.
