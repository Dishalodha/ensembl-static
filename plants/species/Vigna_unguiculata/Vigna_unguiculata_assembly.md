### Assembly
With PacBio data, eight draft assemblies were generated.
Each of the eight assemblies contributed a fraction of its contigs to the final assembly using "stitching".
Scaffolds were obtained by mapping the stitched and
polished assembly to both optical maps using the Kansas
State University pipeline.
A total of 519.4 Mb of sequence scaffold were generated with
an N50 of 16.4 Mb. Finally, a total of 10 genetic
maps containing 44 003 unique Illumina iSelect SNPs were used to anchor and
orient sequence scaffolds into 11 pseudochromosomes via ALLMAPS.
More details about the process can be found in the quoted paper below.
