### Annotation

RNA-seq data (78.5â€‰Gb) was generated from tissue samples collected at 12 different growth stages to assist with annotation of protein-coding genes. Based on a comprehensive strategy of ab initio gene prediction and homology evidence from proteome data sets, ESTs and RNA-seq transcripts, 89,418 non-redundant genes were predicted, of which 4,753 (5.3%) genes encoded two or more alternatively spliced isoforms. More than 95% (85,274) of these annotated genes were located on the pseudochromosomes with the remainder on unanchored scaffolds. Based on sequence identity 97% of the predicted C. sativa genes have homologues in UniProt. RNA-seq evidence suggested that >90% of the genes were expressed (FPKM>0) in one or more developmental stages. 

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There are: 1,298,859 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 84 Mb (13.1% of the genome); 333,331 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat library), covering 128 Mb (20.0% of the genome); 5,216 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library), covering 1 Mb (0.1% of the genome); 333,890 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 30 Mb (4.7% of the genome).
