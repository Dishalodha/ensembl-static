### Annotation

Gene prediction of the assembled genomic scaffolds was conducted by
[JCVI and NRC-Saskatoon](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4097860) using
[MAKER](http://www.yandell-lab.org/software/maker.html "MAKER") and
[PASA](http://pasa.sourceforge.net/ "PASA") with RNA-seq data from four
tissues and homologous protein sequences. Functional annotation for the
gene models is provided through similarity to *Arabidopsis thaliana*
genes.
