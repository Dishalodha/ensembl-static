### Annotation

Protein-coding genes were annotated by the [Munich Information Center
for Protein Sequences](https://www.mpg.de/en) (MIPS) led by Klaus Meyer
using an evidence-based approach. Annotation of repeats and transposable
elements was conducted at [AGI](https://www.genome.arizona.edu/).
Prediction of ncRNA and tRNA genes was conducted at AGI.
