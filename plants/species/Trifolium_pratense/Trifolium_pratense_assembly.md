### Assembly

This assembly from the [Earlham
Institute](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26617401) provides a
chromosome-scale reference draft genome for a red clover genotype of the
variety Milvus (Milvus B) by integration of Whole Genome Sequencing
(WGS) of short-length reads, Sanger-based bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) end sequences, a physical and two genetic maps. WGS was
assembled from paired-end and mate-pair libraries using the Platanus
assembler. Three BAC libraries were created using high molecular weight
DNA from a specific genotype of the Milvus variety (Milvus B). The
mapping population used in this work consisted of 188 genotypes of F1
progeny from a cross between a genotype of the variety Milvus and a
genotype of the variety Britta. 1,031 of the 1,388 markers were aligned
from the two maps to place 532 of the longest scaffolds and used the
BAC-end sequences as markers to further link unplaced scaffolds with
already placed scaffolds from the same physical contig. The physical map
contained 29,730 BACs, of which almost 23,000 were in contigs (77.3%).
