About *Trifolium pratense*
--------------------------

Red clover (*Trifolium pratense*) is one of the most important forage
legume crops in temperate agriculture, and a key component of
sustainable intensification of livestock farming systems. Red clover is
a highly heterozygous diploid (2n = 14) species due to its gametophytic
self-incompatibility system. This assembly provides a chromosome-scale
reference draft genome for a red clover genotype of the variety Milvus
(Milvus B).
