### Annotation

The genome was annotated by [De Vega, JJ, *et
al*.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26617401). Repeats were masked
using RepeatMasker with the RepBase database, LTRharvest38. Transcripts
were annotated using RNA-seq data with *ab initio* predictions and
homologous transcripts from soybean, common bean, and *M. truncatula*.
