### Annotation

A combination of *de novo* gene prediction programs and homology-based
methods were used to [predict gene models in the pigeonpea
genome](https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22057054). These were
combined using the GLEAN algorithm, resulting in the identification of
48,680 genes with an average transcript length of 2,348.70 bp, coding
sequence size of 959.35 bp and 3.59 exons per gene. The majority of
these predicted genes (99.6%) were supported either by de novo gene
prediction, expressed sequence tags (EST)/unigenes or homology-based
searching, or a combination of these approaches. Of these genes Ensembl
Plants display 2212 genes which were imported from ENA (European
Nucleotide Archive).
