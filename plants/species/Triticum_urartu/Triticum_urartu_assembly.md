### Assembly

The genome of *Triticum urartu* (Tu) accession G1812 (PI428198) was sequenced and assembled by the Institute of [Genetics and Developmental Biology Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.genetics.cas.cn/) under the name Tu2.0. The assembled contig sequences were 4.79 Gb with an N50 of 344 kb and scaffold sequences were 4.86 Gb with an N50 of 3.67 Mb, very close to the estimated genome size of 4.94 Gb.
