About *Phaseolus vulgaris*
--------------------------

Legumes are the third largest family of angiosperms and include many
populous species. The majority of legumes contain symbiotic bacteria
within nodules in their roots that mediate nitrogen fixation and provide
an advantage towards competing plants. Legume seeds are rich in protein
content and thus many species have been used for human or animal
consumption over the years. Legumes as a whole constitute the second
largest class of crops, including peas, soybeans, peanuts, and beans.
Common bean (*Phaseolus vulgaris*) is fundamental for the nutrition of
more than 500 million people in developing countries and a major source
of protein that complements carbohydrate-rich rice, maize, and cassava.
