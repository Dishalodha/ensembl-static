### Assembly

Although clementines of cultivar Clemenules are diploid (2n=2x=18), the
sequenced genotype is a haploid generated by in situ parthenogenesis
induced by irradiated pollen of Fortune mandarin followed by direct
embryo germination in vitro. A total of 4.6 million Sanger reads
(including both fosmid-end and BAC-end reads), were generated by the
ICGC, Genoscope, IGA and JGI totaling 7x coverage. Sequences were
assembled with Arachne and integrated with a genetic map producing
chromosome-scale pseudomolecules. The resulting 301.4Mb assembly
(Citrus\_clementina\_v1.0) is nearly complete, with high assembly
contiguity (contig L50 = 119 kb) and scaffolding (scaffold L50 before
pseudo-chromosome construction = 6.8 Mb) . Overall, 45% of the sequence
is repetitive.
