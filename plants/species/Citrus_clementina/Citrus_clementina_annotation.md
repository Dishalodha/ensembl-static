### Annotation

Long-read 454 and Sanger expressed-sequence-tags (ESTs) were generated.
First these were used to validate the assembly, as early 97% aligned to
the reference sequence. In addition, they were used to refine gene
predictions made with FGenesH+, exonerate and GenomeScan. This produced
an annotation 25,000 protein coding loci.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: 644239 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 29 Mb (9.6% of the
genome); 133691 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat library), covering
45 Mb (14.9% of the genome); 3453 RepeatMasker features (with the
RepBase library), covering 0 Mb (0.1% of the genome); 169903 Tandem
repeats (TRF) features, covering 24 Mb (8.1% of the genome);
Repeat Detector repeats length 110Mb (36.6% of the genome).
