### Assembly

The genome sequence, assembly and protein coding genes annotation of the
*Musa acuminata* ssp. malaccensis doubled-haploid genome have been
generated by the [Global Musa Genomics
Consortium](http://www.musagenomics.org), led jointly by the
[CIRAD](http://banana-genome.cirad.fr/) and the
[Genoscope](http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/spip/spip.php?lang=en).

Its genome was released in July 2012 consisting of 24,425 contigs and
7,513 scaffolds with a total length of 472.2 Mb, which represented 90%
of the estimated DH-Pahang genome size. 70% of the assembly (332 Mb)
were anchored along the 11 Musa linkage groups of the Pahang genetic
map.
