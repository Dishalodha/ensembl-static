### Assembly

Complementary approaches were combined to obtain the pea reference genome assembly. Whole-genome Illumina short-read sequences were assembled into contigs using SoapdeNovo, then combined into scaffolds using long-range PacBio RSII sequences and whole-genome profiling of a bacterial articial chromosome (BAC) library. Scaffolds were manually curated for inter and intrachromosomal chimeras using sequences obtained from single chromosomes isolated by flow-cytometr and ultra-high-density skim genotyping-by-sequencing genetic map. Curated scaffolds were then integrated into 24,623 super-scaffolds (L50 of 415 kilobases (kb)) using BioNano maps. The seven pseudomolecules representing the pea chromosomes were obtained by anchoring super-scaffolds onto high-density genetic maps. Pseudomolecules were named according to the reference pea genetic map25 and chromosome numbering.
