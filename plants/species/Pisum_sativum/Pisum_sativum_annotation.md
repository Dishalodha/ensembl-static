### Annotation

Ab initio and homology-based methods were combined to annotate protein-coding sequences. In total, 44,756 complete and 29 truncated genes were predicted, with an average gene length, coding sequence length and exon number of 2,784 base pairs (bp), 1,016 bp and 6.33 exons, respectively. The vast majority of gene models were supported by complementary DNA/expressed sequence tag evidence.
