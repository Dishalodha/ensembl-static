### Annotation

RNA sequencing data from 12 tissues and ab initio analysis informed a
genome-wide manual annotation, using the WebApollo tool. In total,
33,044 gene loci represented by 33,123 isoforms were identified, named
and tagged for quality of evidential support. Of these 3114 (9.4%) were
identical to a protein within variety \'Hongyang\' in the Kiwifruit
Information Resource (KIR v2). The quality of the new gene models was
tested by fully sequencing 550 cloned \'Hort16A\' cDNAs and comparing
with the predicted protein models for Red5. Overall, 90.9% had a match
with 90% identity or better.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines]http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 204260489 - Repeats content: 36.8%
