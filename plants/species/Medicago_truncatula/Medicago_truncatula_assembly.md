### Assembly

*Medicago truncatula* cultivar A17 was sequenced and assembled by the
[*Medicago truncatula* Sequencing
Consortium](http://medicago.jcvi.org/cgi-bin/medicago/overview.cgi) in
2011 (Mt3.5, then updated in 2014 (Mt4.0). The Mt4.0 comprises
approximately 360 Mb of sequences in psudeomolecules spanning 390 Mb of
which \~330 Mb aligns accurately with the Optical Map, with only \~20 Mb
of unplaced sequence.
