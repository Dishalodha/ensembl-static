### Annotation

[JCVI](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24767513) published the current
gene set in 2014. Altogether, Pseudomolecules and unassigned BACs
contain a total of 50,444 protein-coding gene loci (\~31,500 high
confidence genes and \~19,000 low confidence genes). The pseudomolecules
were annotated by combining Mt3.5 gene models, with predictions from
[Augustus](http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/) and
[FGENESH](http://www.molquest.com/help/2.3/programs/Fgenesh/description.html)
as well as expression data and protein matches primarily using [Evidence
Modeler (EVM)](http://evidencemodeler.sourceforge.net/). Whenever
possible, gene identifiers have been preserved between Mt3.5 and Mt4.0.

Additional analysis was carried out in house: non coding RNA genes have
been annotated using
[tRNAScan-SE](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC146525),
[Rfam](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15608160), and
[RNAmmer](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1888812).

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 134713950 - Repeats content: 32.6%
