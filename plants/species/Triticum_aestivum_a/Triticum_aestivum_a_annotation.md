Annotations
-----------

The predicted gene annotations come from
[Exonerate](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/%7Eguy/exonerate/) alignments of wheat
coding sequences (CDS) from two sets of transcripts: *Triticum turgidum*
assembled RNAseq data (Genome Biology 2013, 14:R66, Supplemental dataset
7) and a collection of publicly available wheat transcripts filtered to
exclude pseudogenes, sequences shorter than 90 bp, and ORFs similar to
those present in the *T. turgidum* set. See
[Triticeae-CAP](http://maswheat.ucdavis.edu/Transcriptome/) project page
for more information.\
The program findorf was used to predict the CDS within these transcripts
as described in \[2\].
