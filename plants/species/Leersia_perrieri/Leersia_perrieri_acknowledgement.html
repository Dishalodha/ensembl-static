You   are encouraged use these data to advance your research on individual loci but are asked to respect the rights of the investigators who generated these data to publish the whole-genome level description of the <em>Leersia perrieri</em> in a peer-reviewed journal. This description includes whole-genome comparative analyses, genome size evolution, gene family evolution, gene organisation and movement, heterochromatin, centromere evolution. This genome falls under the scope of the I-OMAP (International Oryza Map Alignment Project) consortium. The I-OMAP consortium is an internationally coordinated effort to create high-quality reference assemblies representing the diversity of wild and crop-progenitor species in the genus Oryza (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2013.02.014">Jacquemin et al, 2012</a>).
