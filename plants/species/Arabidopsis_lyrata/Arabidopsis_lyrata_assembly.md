### Assembly

The genome was assembled by the [Stanford Human Genome
Center](http://med.stanford.edu/sgtc/) with assistance from the [*A.
lyrata* community](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21478890).
Sequencing followed a whole genome shotgun strategy and achieved an
average genome coverage of 8x. The 206.7 Mb Araly1 assembly contains 695
nuclear scaffolds.
