### Assembly

A total of 144.1 Gb high-quality cleaned Illumina paired-end and
mate-pair reads were generated, representing 291x genome coverage. Based
on the 17-mer depth distribution of the reads, accession NCNSP0323 is
highly homozygous, with an estimated genome size of 495.9 Mb. Long-read
PacBio data (5x) was used for gap-filling and used in combination with
de novo-assembled BioNano maps to improve the assembly. The resulting
assembly was 457.8 Mb with scaffold N50 length of 6.9 Mb. To construct
pseudomolecules, a high-density genetic map for related *I. trifida* was
generated and used to anchor 216 scaffolds (443.3 Mb; 96.8% of the
assembly). To further evaluate the assembly, RNA-Seq reads from a set of
developmental tissues were aligned. Overall 91.4% of the reads aligned.
In addition, 94.6% of the core conserved plant genes were found complete
(BUSCO).
