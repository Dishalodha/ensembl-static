### Annotation

Two rounds of MAKER annotation, followed by manual curation to separate
genes and alleles, yielded over 35,500 genes with allele-specific
resolution. These included 4,289 (12.7%) genes with 4 alleles, 9,792
(27.6%) with 3, 14,797 (41.7%) with 3, and finally 6,647 (18.7%) with
one allele resolved. BUSCO v3 was used for evaluation of annotation
completeness. Out of 1,440 conserved genes, 1,397 (97.1%) were
re-annotated in the AP85-441 genome, among which 1,101 (76.5%) were
complete genes.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat
feature](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html) pipeline.
There are: 3,066,463 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 85 Mb
(3.0% of the genome); 1,621,792 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat),
covering 1,257 Mb (43.3% of the genome); 35,078 RepeatMasker features
(with the RepBase library), covering 4 Mb (0.1% of the genome);
1,145,071 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 145 Mb (5.0% of the
genome); Repeat Detector repeats length 1.86Gb (64.3% of the genome).
