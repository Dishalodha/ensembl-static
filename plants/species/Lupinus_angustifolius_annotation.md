### Annotation

A total of 33,074 protein-coding genes were annotated by the
[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5316927), after combining
evidence from transcriptome alignments derived from five different
tissue types (leaf, stem, root, flower and seed), protein homology, and
*in silico* gene prediction. Additionally, peptide data from proteomics
analysis of leaf, seed, stem and root samples were mapped to both the
translated gene annotations and the 6-frame translation of the
whole-genome assembly. Proteogenomic comparison of peptide-mapping
versus gene annotation supported between 94 and 1134 annotations per
tissue type, and provided valuable information on tissue localisation
for the products of these genes. InterPro terms were the most
informative functional annotation assigned to NLL proteins with 26,580
(80.4%) proteins annotated.
