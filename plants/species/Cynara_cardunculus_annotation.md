### Annotation

Gene prediction utilized reiterative runs of the MAKER suite. Both EST
sequences and RNAseq data were used to guide gene annotation. The
annotation pipeline yielded 26,889 gene models (and a total of 27,121
predicted transcripts), of which 23,895 were located in the chromosomal
pseudomolecules.
