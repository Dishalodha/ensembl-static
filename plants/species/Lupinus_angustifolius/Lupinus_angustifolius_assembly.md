### Assembly

The lupin genome assembly was produced by the [Commonwealth Scientific
and Industrial Research
Organisation](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5316927). The haploid
genome size for NLL was previously estimated by flow cytometry to be 924
Mb. K-mer-based estimation of genome size predicted a similar value of
951 Mb. Initial assembly of the Tanjil genome using only paired-end
Illumina data produced 191,701 scaffolds in 521 Mb, with an N50 of
10,137 and N50 length of 13.8 kb. The assembly was improved via
scaffolding with additional paired-end, mate-pairs and BAC-end data
totalling an average coverage of 162.8x. This resulted in a contig
assembly with 1,068,669 contigs, totalling 810 Mb or 85% of the
k-mer-based estimated genome size. The final scaffold assembly after
removing scaffolds less than 200 bp comprised 14,379 scaffolds totalling
609 Mb with a contig N50 length of 45,646 bp and scaffold N50 of 232 and
scaffold N50 length of 703 kb.
