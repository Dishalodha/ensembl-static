### Assembly
For de novo assembly of the SY genome, four sequencing and assembly technologies were integrated: PacBio long-read sequencing, Illumina short-read sequencing, BioNano optical mapping and Hi-C data. The SY genome size was estimated to be 1056.53 Mb by k-mer analysis, close to the 1,068 Mb estimated by flow cytometry. PacBio reads (~93×) were first assembled using FALCON, followed by contig correction using Illumina reads (~130×) to generate a V.1 assembly. Using 202-fold coverage of BioNano data, an optical consensus map was generated, which was implemented to assemble 1,897 super-scaffolds with an N50 of 5.87 Mb (assembly V.2). These contigs were categorized and ordered into 18 chromosome-scale scaffolds using a 15,543-marker high-density linkage map. Finally, Hi-C data was used to confirm the pseudo-chromosomes and manually adjusted 165 mis-joined contigs by Juicebox. The final SY assembly captured 933.5 Mb of genome sequence, with 867.3 Mb (~92.9%) anchored into chromosomes, which is superior to previous assemblies of stem and Indian mustard in terms of genome size, contiguity and anchorage.
