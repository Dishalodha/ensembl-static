### Annotation

Among 92,878 predicted gene models, 95.5% were functionally annotated in public databases. Alignment to known proteins and expression in at least one tissue type showed 82,723 gene models were high-confidence (HC) genes, with an average coding sequence length of ~1.13â€‰kb and an average of five exons per gene, similarly to predictions in other Brassica genomes (Supplementary Table 13). A total of 5,756 genes (6.96% of the HC genes) encoded putative transcription factors belonging to 58 different families.
