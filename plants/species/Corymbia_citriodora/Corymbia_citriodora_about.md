About *Corymbia citriodora*
---------------------
*Corymbia citriodora* is a member of the predominantly Southern Hemisphere Myrtaceae family, which includes the eucalypts (Eucalyptus, Corymbia and Angophora; ~800 species). Corymbia is grown for timber, pulp and paper, and essential oils in Australia, South Africa, Asia, and Brazil, maintaining a high-growth rate under marginal conditions due to drought, poor-quality soil, and biotic stresses.

<!-- *Arabidopsis thaliana* is a small flowering plant that is widely used as
a model organism in plant biology. Arabidopsis is a member of the
mustard (Brassicaceae) family, which includes cultivated species such as
cabbage and radish. Arabidopsis is not of major agronomic significance,
but its small genome size and ease of cultivation offer important
advantages for basic research in genetics and molecular biology.
*Arabidopsis thaliana* has a genome size of \~135 Mb, and a haploid
chromosome number of five. -->
