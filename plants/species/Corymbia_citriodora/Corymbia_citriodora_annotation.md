### Annotation
To annotate the genome, RNA was collected from five separate tissues (expanded leaves [EL], unexpanded leaves [UL], flower buds [FB], flower initials [FI], photosynthetic bark cortex [BA]) and was used for de novo gene model prediction. The final annotation of protein-coding gene products comprised 35,632 primary transcripts and 10,019 alternative transcripts for a total of 45,651 transcript models. The set of primary transcripts had a mean length of 3.4 Kb, a mean of 4.8 exons, with a median exon length of 176 bp and a median intron length of 202 bp.
