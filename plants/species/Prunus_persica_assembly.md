### Assembly

[JGI](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23525075) performed the initial
assembly using Sanger sequence reads representing 8.5-fold coverage of a
double haploid genotype of cv. Lovell using
[Arachne](http://www.broadinstitute.org/crd/wiki/index.php/Arachne_Main_Page).
The resulting contigs and scaffolds were filtered to give 234 scaffolds
covering 224.6 Mb of the peach genome (Peach v1.0) with scaffold and
contig N50/L50 values of 4 Mb/26.8 Mb and 294 kb/214.2 kb, respectively
with good QC statistics.

Five DNA libraries were end-sequenced, giving a total of 8.47-fold
sequence coverage: 536,032 reads from the 2.8 kb sized library, 606,680
reads from the 4.4 kb sized library, 2,106,103 reads from the 7.8 kb
sized library, 419,424 reads from the 35.3 kb fosmid library, and 61,440
reads from the 69.5 kb BAC library.
