About *Arabidopsis halleri*
---------------------------

The self-incompatible species *Arabidopsis halleri* is a close relative
of the self-compatible model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana*. The broad
European and Asian distribution and heavy metal hyperaccumulation
ability make *A. halleri* a useful model for ecological genomics
studies. The sequenced individual, *A. halleri* ssp. *gemmifera* Tada
mine genotype (W302), was collected from a site with high contamination
by heavy metals in Japan.
