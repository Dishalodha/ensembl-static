### Assembly

The double haploid sugar beet line KWS2320 was sequenced by [Dohm *et
al*](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24352233) (2014) using the
Roche/454, Illumina and Sanger sequencing platforms. The initial
assembly was integrated with genome-wide genetic and physical map
information, resulting in 225 genetically anchored scaffolds (394.6 Mb),
assigned to nine chromosomes. The final assembly comprised 566.6 Mb in
2,171 scaffolds and 38,337 unscaffolded contigs. The N50 size was 2.01
Mb and the chromosomally assigned fraction 84.7%. A total of 94% of the
publicly available isogenic expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were located
in the assembly, suggesting that gene-containing regions are
comprehensively covered.
