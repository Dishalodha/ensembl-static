### Annotation

[Dohm *et al*](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24352233) (2014) used
Illumina RNA-seq reads and other cDNAs to annotate a total of 27,421
protein-coding genes; 91% included start and stop codons. They
identified ncRNAs using homology searches.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 218713351 - Repeats content: 38.6%
