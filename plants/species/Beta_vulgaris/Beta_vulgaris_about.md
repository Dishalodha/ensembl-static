About *Beta vulgaris*
---------------------

Sugar beet (*Beta vulgaris* ssp. vulgaris) is an important crop of
temperate climates providing nearly 30% of the world\'s annual sugar
production and a source for bioethanol and animal feed. The species
belongs to the order of Caryophylalles, is diploid with 2n=18
chromosomes, has an estimated genome size of 714-758 Mb and shares an
ancient genome triplication with other eudicot plants. Leafy beets have
been cultivated since Roman times, but sugar beet is one of the most
recently domesticated crops.
