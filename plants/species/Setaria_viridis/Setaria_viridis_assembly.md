### Assembly

A platinum-quality genome sequence (v2.0) for reference line A10.1 was generated by assembling 4.7M PACBIO reads (118x) with the MECAT assembler and subsequently polished using QUIVER. 425.6M Illumina HiSeq reads (240x) were used for correcting homozygous SNP/indel errors. A set of 36,061 syntenic markers derived from the version 2.2 *Setaria italica* release was aligned to the MECAT assembly. Misjoins were characterized as a discontinuity in the italica linkage group. A total of 15 breaks were identified and made. The viridis scaffolds were then oriented, ordered, and joined together into 9 chromosomes using syntenic markers. A total of 61 joins were made during this process, each padded with 10K Ns. Significant telomeric sequence was identified using the TTTAGGG repeat. The final assembly contains 395.1 Mb of sequence, consisting of 75 contigs with a contig N50 of 11.2 Mb and a total of 99.95% of assembled bases in chromosomes.
