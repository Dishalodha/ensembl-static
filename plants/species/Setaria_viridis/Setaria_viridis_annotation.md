### Annotation

The genome sequence was annotated using the unpublished Joint Genome Institute plant annotation pipeline to identify 38,334 gene models with 14,125 alternative transcripts.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There are: 384,561 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 11 Mb (2.8% of the genome); 194,994 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat library), covering 100 Mb (25.2% of the genome); 2,178 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library), covering 0 Mb (0.1% of the genome); 159600 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 17 Mb (4.2% of the genome).
