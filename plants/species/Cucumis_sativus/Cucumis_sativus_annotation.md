### Annotation

The [Cucumber Genome
Initiative](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19881527) predicted
protein coding genes using three methods (cDNA-EST, homology based and
*ab initio*) and a consensus gene set was built by merging all of the
results. A total of 26,682 genes were predicted, with a mean coding
sequence size of 1,046 bp and an average of 4.39 exons per gene. Under
an 80% sequence overlap threshold, 26.7% of the genes were supported by
all three gene prediction methods, 25% had both *ab initio* prediction
and homology-based evidence, and 7.4% had *ab initio* prediction and
cDNA-EST expression evidence; the remaining genes were primarily derived
from pure *ab initio* prediction, but the majority of these were
supported by multiple gene finders. About 81% of the genes have
homologues in the TrEMBL protein database, and 66% can be classified by
InterPro. In total, 82% of the genes have either known homologues or can
be functionally classified.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 93375853 - Repeats content: 48.2%
