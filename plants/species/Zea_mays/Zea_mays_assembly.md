### Assembly

This entirely new assembly of the maize genome ([B73
RefGen\_v4](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28605751)) is constructed
from PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing at approximately
60-fold coverage and scaffolded with the aid of a high-resolution
whole-genome restriction (optical) mapping. The pseudomolecules of maize
B73 RefGen\_v4 are assembled nearly end-to-end, representing a 52-fold
improvement in average contig size relative to the previous reference
(B73 RefGen\_v3).
