### Regulation

**Gene expression probes**

Oligo probes from the [GeneChip Maize Genome
Array](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/900614?SID=srch-hj-900614)
have been aligned using the standard [Ensembl 2-step mapping
procedure](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/microarray_mapping).

#### **DNA methylation**

Genomewide patterns of DNA methylation for two maize inbred lines, B73
and Mo17, are now displayed on the maize genome browser. Cytosine
methylation in symmetric (CG and CHG, where H is A, C, or T) context is
associated with DNA replication and histone modification. CG (65%) and
CHG (50%) methylation is also highest in transposons. Source: Maize
methylome publication by Regulski *et al.* (2013).
