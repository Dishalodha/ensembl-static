### Assembly

Amborella\'s draft genome sequence was published in December, 2013, by
the [Amborella Genome
Project](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24357323). Initial sequencing
and contig assembly was performed using a whole-genome shotgun (WGS)
strategy. Contigs and scaffold assignments were refined, and
superscaffolds constructed from them using evidence from end-sequenced
BACs, single-molecule restriction digest (OpGen) experiments, and
fluorescent *in situ* hybridisation (FISH) experiments.
