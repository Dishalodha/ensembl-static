### Assembly

The homozygous *B. napus* genome of European winter oilseed cultivar
Darmor-*bzh* was assembled with long-read 454 GS-FLX+ Titanium and
Sanger sequence. Correction and gap filling used 79 Gb of Illumina HiSeq
sequence. The final assembly of 849.7 Mb was obtained using SOAP and
Newbler, with 89% nongapped sequence. The assembly covers \~79% of the
1,130 Mb genome and includes 95.6% of *Brassica* expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) and was [produced by
GSC](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/25146293).
