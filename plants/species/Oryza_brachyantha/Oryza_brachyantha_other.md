### Gramene/Ensembl Genomes Annotation

Additional annotations generated by the Gramene and Ensembl Plants
project include:

-   Gene phylogenetic trees with other Gramene species.
-   LastZ Whole Genome Alignment to *Arabidopsis thaliana*, *Oryza
    sativa* Japonica (IRGSP v1) and other *Oryza* AA genomes.
-   Orthologue based
    [DAGchainer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15247098) synteny
    detection against other AA genomes.
-   Mapping to the genome of multiple sequence-based feature sets using
    [Gramene BLAT
    pipeline](http://docs.gramene.org/Blat_pipeline:_sequence_mapping_analysis).
-   Identification of various repeat features by programs such as
    RepeatMasker with MIPS and AGI repeat libraries, and Dust, TRF.
