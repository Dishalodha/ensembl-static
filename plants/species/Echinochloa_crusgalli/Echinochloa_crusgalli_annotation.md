### Annotation

For gene annotation, transcriptomic data from the whole plant were generated by RNA-Seq. By integrating gene finding results from ab initio, homology- and transcript-based approaches, 108,771 protein-coding in the E. crus-galli genome were predicted. Of the 108,771 genes, 85% were supported by either the identification of homologues in other species or RNA-Seq data. In addition to protein-coding genes, 785 microRNAs (miRNAs) and other non-coding RNAs were also identified in the E. crus-galli genome.
