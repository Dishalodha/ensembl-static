### Assembly

The genome of the Tsedey improved variety was assembled by the Tef
Improvement Project (<https://tef-research.org>) at the Institute of
Plant Sciences of the University of Bern, Switzerland, with assistance
from the Swiss Institute of Bionformatics. A whole-genome shotgun
strategy resulted in an average genome coverage of 44x with Illumina
short reads and 7x with 454 pyrosequencing. The 672 Mb assembly contains
around 14,000 nuclear scaffolds greater than 1000 bp and represents
about 87% of the genome size estimated from flow cytometry.
