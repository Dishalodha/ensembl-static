About *Prunus dulcis*
---------------------

Almond (*Prunus dulcis*) is a rosaceous tree species cultivated for its
seeds; it has a diploid (2n = 2x = 16) and compact genome (about 300
Mbp). The origin of the almond tree is not well established; its closest
wild relatives live in central and western Asia, stretching from the
Himalayas to the eastern Mediterranean Basin. The genus Prunus comprises
a group of approximately 200 species, some of which, such as peach,
apricot, cherry, plum and almond have high economic value. The high
level of genomic resemblance and synteny among the species of this genus
enables production of hybrids that are sometimes fertile.
