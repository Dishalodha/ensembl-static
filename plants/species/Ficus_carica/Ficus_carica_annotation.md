To produce a comprehensive gene annotation both ab initio and transcriptome-based strategies were used. The assembled transcriptome consisted of 127470 contigs with an average length of 1455 bp. Gene average length was 2460 bp and coding sequence (CDS) average length was 956 bp. The average exon number per gene was 4.56, with an average length of 251 bp, while intron average length was 367 bp. In total, exon length was 43.5 Mbp, while intron length was 49.55 Mbp. Functional annotation showed that 28737 of the predicted protein-coding genes (76% of the total) had a BLAST hit (E-value < 0.001) in NCBI nr.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There are:
* 357554 Red features, covering 124 Mb (37.2% of the genome);
* 1105757 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 38 Mb (11.4% of the genome);
* 137725 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), covering 37 Mb (11.0% of the genome);
* 420051 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 26 Mb (7.8% of the genome).
