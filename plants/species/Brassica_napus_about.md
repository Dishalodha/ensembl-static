About *Brassica napus*
----------------------

Oilseed rape (*Brassica napus*) was formed \~7,500 years ago by
hybridisation between [*B.
rapa*](http://plants.ensembl.org/Brassica_rapa/Info/Annotation/) and
[*B.
oleracea*](http://plants.ensembl.org/Brassica_oleracea/Info/Annotation/),
followed by chromosome doubling, a process known as allopolyploidy.
Together with more ancient polyploidsations, this conferred an aggregate
72-fold genome multiplication since the origin of angiosperms and high
gene content. Cultivation began in Europe during the Middle Ages and
spread worldwide. Diversifying selection gave rise to oilseed rape,
swede, fodder rape, and kale morphotypes grown for oil, fodder and food.
