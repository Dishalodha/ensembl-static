### Annotation

[The Amborella genome
project](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24357323) carried out *ab
initio* annotation of genes and repetitive elements using the
[DAWGPAWS](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19545381) and
[EVidenceModeler](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/18190707) software
packages. These annotations were refined through manual comparison with
assembled Amborella cDNA transcripts, gene family analyses, and homology
studies.
