### Assembly

A whole genome shotgun assembly (i.e. Illumina sequence, SOAP de novo
assembly) of *O. longistaminata* was generated by Professor Wen Wang
([Kunming Institute of Zoology](http://english.kiz.cas.cn/), Chinese
Academy of Sciences) in collaboration with
[BGI-Shenzhen](http://www.genomics.cn/en/). The genome assembly was
composed of 135,973 scaffolds spanning 344.6 Mb with a N50 scaffold size
of 62.4 kb. Using this assembly, the [Arizona Genomics Institute
(AGI)](https://www.genome.arizona.edu/) selected scaffolds and contigs
that were syntenic to the short arm of chromosome 3 of *O. sativa*
ssp.japonica, and the order and orientation of each scaffold/contig was
confirmed using Genome Puzzle Mater software (GPM, unpublished) to
produce a Chr3S pseudomolecule. The final *O. longistaminata* chromosome
3 short arm resulted in a single scaffold of 14,404,039 bp composed of
4,724 contigs.
