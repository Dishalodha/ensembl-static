### Gramene/Ensembl Genomes Annotation

Additional annotations generated by the Gramene and Ensembl Plants
project include:

-   Gene phylogenetic trees with other other Gramene species, [see
    example](/Oryza_rufipogon/Gene/Compara_Tree?g=ORUFI01G00010;r=1:4806-7125).
-   Mapping to the genome of multiple sequence-based feature sets using
    [gramene blat
    pipeline](http://docs.gramene.org/Blat_pipeline:_sequence_mapping_analysis),
    [see example](/Oryza_rufipogon/Location/View?r=1:8001-18000).
-   Identification of various repeat features by programs such as
    RepeatMasker with MIPS and AGI repeat libraries, and Dust, TRF.
