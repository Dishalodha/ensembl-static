### Annotation

Protein-coding gene annotation was performed with evidence-based MAKER-P
genome annotation pipeline. Non coding RNA genes were predicted with
Infernal and tRNA genes with tRNAscan. RepeatMasker was used to annotate
repeats and transposable elements with Oryza-specific de novo repeat
libraries. These analyses were conducted at Arizona Genomics Institute
(AGI) led by Dr. Rod Wing.
