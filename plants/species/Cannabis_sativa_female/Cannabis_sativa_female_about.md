About *Cannabis sativa*
-----------------------

*Cannabis sativa* (hemp) has been cultivated for millennia with distinct cultivars providing either fiber, oil and confectionary seed or tetrahydrocannabinol. It is diploid (2n=20) and its native range is SE European Russia to NW China and Pakistan. This is a dioecious species with sexual dimorphism occurring in a late stage of plant development. Sex is determined by heteromorphic chromosomes: male is the heterogametic sex (XY) and female is the homogametic one (XX). Sex is considered an important trait for hemp genetic improvement.
