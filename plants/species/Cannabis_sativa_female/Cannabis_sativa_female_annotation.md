### Annotation

Full-length cDNAs, Stringtie assembly of 142 RNAseq libraries, and Trinity transcripts were assembled into gene models with PASA. Genes were also predicted ab initio using Augustus. Non redundant RefSeq Viridiplantae proteins were clustered at 90% identity with CD-HIT and representative sequences aligned to the reference. Pairwise hits were locally realigned with AAT and Exonerate protein2genome and PASA updated. 

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There are: 1,532,461 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 87 Mb (9.9% of the genome); 175,269 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat library), covering 97 Mb (11.1% of the genome); 9,445 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library), covering 1 Mb (0.2% of the genome); 461,225 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 33 Mb (3.8% of the genome); Repeat Detector repeats length 439Mb (50.2% of the genome).
