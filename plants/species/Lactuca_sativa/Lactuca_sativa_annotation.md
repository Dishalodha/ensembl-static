### Annotation
A high confidence gene set of 38,919 gene models with good protein or EST support was constructed for L. sativa by merging gene models from different prediction pipelines. These gene models have average coding lengths of 1.05 kb and 4.5 exons per gene, similar to those in other sequenced plant genomes. The average intergenic distance of 39.5 kb places L. sativa between Nicotiana tomentosis and Capsicum annum consistent with a direct correlation between intergenic distance and genome size. Out of the total number of predicted genes, 29,681 (76.27%) genes had similarity to Arabidopsis TAIR10 annotations and 28,951 (74.3%) were annotated using InterProScan521. Annotation using KEGG22 database yielded information for 7,553 L. sativa gene predictions. The combined data sets provided functional annotation for 31,348 (80.5%) gene models.(1)
