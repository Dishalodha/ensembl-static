### Assembly
A whole-genome shotgun strategy was used to sequence and assemble the genome of L. sativa cultivar Salinas from Illumina short reads. A total of 198.5 Gb Illumina paired-end and mate-pair reads were generated from seven libraries of different fragment sizes. After filtering, this provided 72.5-fold coverage of the 2.7 Gb genome as estimated by K-mer analysis. This initial SOAPdenovo assembly consisted of 153,952 contigs and 21,686 scaffolds greater than 1 kb with the largest scaffold being 3.1 Mb. The N50s of contigs and scaffolds were 12 and 476 kb, respectively. The mean size of gaps in the scaffolds was 1.3 kb. The Chicago library data (in vitro proximity ligation) scaffolded with the HiRise software pipeline (Dovetail Genomics LLC, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) increased the contiguity of scaffolds considerably. The final HiRise assembly decreased the 21,686 scaffolds to 11,474 superscaffolds and increased the N50 from 476 to 1,769 kb; 50 and 90% of the genome is represented in only 385 and 1,520 superscaffolds, respectively. The largest superscaffold is 12.2 Mb and contains 27 SOAPdenovo scaffolds. The total length of the assembly is 2.38 Gb, covering ∼88% of the estimated genome size of L. sativa.
A total of 9,140 scaffolds of the L. sativa assembly could be clustered into nine chromosomal linkage groups and then mapped into genetic bins ordered along each chromosomal linkage group.

<!-- The current genome assembly of *Arabidopsis thaliana* is
[TAIR10](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17986450), produced by NCBI
using data provided by TAIR, based in the Col-0 ecotype. It was
determined by a BAC-by-BAC sequencing strategy anchored to chromosomes
using a variety of genetic and physical maps. -->
