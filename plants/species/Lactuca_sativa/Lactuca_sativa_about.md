About *Genus species*
---------------------
Lettuce (*Lactuca sativa L.*) is an important vegetable crop species and ranks as one of the top 10 most valuable crops in the USA with an annual value of over $2.4 billion. 
L. sativa is diploid with 2n=2x=18 chromosomes and an estimated genome size of 2.5 Gb.
Lettuce belongs to Compositae (also known as Asteraceae) family whichis the most successful family of flowering plants on earth in terms of number of species and diversity of habitats colonized. 
The family is thought to have originated in the mid-Eocene (45–49 Myr) and expanded greatly during the Oligocene (28–36 Myr). 
It encompasses 1,620 recognized genera and at least 23,600 species, constituting approximately 10% of all angiosperms. 


<!-- *Arabidopsis thaliana* is a small flowering plant that is widely used as
a model organism in plant biology. Arabidopsis is a member of the
mustard (Brassicaceae) family, which includes cultivated species such as
cabbage and radish. Arabidopsis is not of major agronomic significance,
but its small genome size and ease of cultivation offer important
advantages for basic research in genetics and molecular biology.
*Arabidopsis thaliana* has a genome size of \~135 Mb, and a haploid
chromosome number of five. -->
