### Assembly

The genome of *Triticum urartu* accession G1812 was sequenced by the
[BGI](http://www.genomics.cn/en/index) using a whole-genome shotgum
strategy, and assembled using SOAPdenovo software. The genome assembly
reached 3.92 Gb with a N50 size of 3.42 kb. After gap closure, the draft
assembly was 4.66 Gb, with a scaffold N50 length of 63.69 kb.

The chloroplast genome component and its gene annotation are also
present. This was imported from ENA entry,
[KC912693](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/KC912693).
