About *Musa acuminata*
----------------------

*Musa acuminata* (banana) is native to tropical South and Southeast Asia
and is cultivated throughout the tropics. Grown primarily for its fruit,
rich in starch, banana is the most popular fruit in industrialised
countries. Cultivars mainly involve *Musa acuminata* (A-genome) and
*Musa balbisiana* (B-genome) and are sometimes diploid but generally
triploid. Banana was the first non-grass monocotyledon to be sequenced,
making it an important genome for the comparative analysis of plants.
This sequence corresponds to a doubled-haploid plant of cultivar Pahang.
