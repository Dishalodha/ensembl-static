### Annotation

Two independent annotations of the initial version of the banana genome assembly were available
and both were transferred to the new assembly. The *M. acuminata* transcripts from the first annotation [2] 
in addition to several manually curated gene annotation were transferred to the new assembly version. 
The same transfer was performed for the [NCBI Refseq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/Musa_acuminata/100) 
annotation. 

Based on the analysis of several manually curated genes, the NCBI RefSeq genome annotation proved 
to be generally of better quality than the first published annotation. In addition, the NCBI RefSeq 
genome annotation integrated RNAseq data and predicted alternative transcripts. We thus created a 
consensus annotation that combined all the manually curated genes, the NCBI Refseq annotation and 
the predicted genes from the first annotation that were missed by the Refseq annotation pipeline. 
The consensus annotation contains 35,276 predicted genes with 34,629 (98.2 %) located in chromosomes. 
Locus nomenclature was modified to avoid confusion; for example, 
GSMUA_Achr5t02570_001 in version 1 becomes Ma05_t02680.1 in the current annotation.
