### Assembly

The original genome assembly draft of *Musa acuminata* ssp. malaccensis doubled-haploid [2],
generated by the [Global Musa Genomics Consortium](http://www.musagenomics.org), led jointly by the
[Alliance Bioversity-CIRAD](http://banana-genome.cirad.fr/) and 
[Genoscope](http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/spip/spip.php?lang=en), 
was improved in successive steps [3].

The original 24,425 contigs were re-assembled into scaffolds exploiting paired end (PE) data and 
new 5 kb mate-pair illumina sequences (40x coverage). Contigs were assembled into 2,267 scaffolds 
for a cumulated size of 439 Mb representing 84% of the estimated size (523 Mb) of the DH-Pahang genome. 

Thirty six misassembled regions identified in 33 scaffolds split, resulting in a total of 2,303 scaffolds. 
Based on discordant paired-reads, a total of 438 scaffold fusions and 293 scaffold junctions were performed.
A total of 9,838 gap regions were filled using 330bp PE libraries (50x).

The final assembly consisted of 1,532 scaffolds and showed a cumulative size of 450.7 Mb corresponding to 86% 
of the estimated genome size. Ninety percent of the assembly was in 267 scaffolds and the N50 was 3.0 Mb. 
Gaps in scaffolds represent 45.2 Mb (10.0% of the assembly). 

Genetic markers were then used to assembled scaffolds into pseudo-molecules. A total of 21,603 markers that mapped 
to a unique position were grouped into 11 linkage groups or pseudo-molecules, with an average of 5.44 markers per 100 kb.

The final assembly contains the 11 chromosomes (+ 1 ChrUnk with unplaced contigs concatenated) and the mitochondrial genome.
