### Annotation

The annotation presented is [derived from annotation submitted to
INSDC](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/insdc_annotation) with the
assembly accession
[GCA\_000350225.2](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000350225.2),
with additional non-coding genes derived from
[Rfam](http://rfam.xfam.org/).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/repeat_features). There
are: 59,047 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 3 Mb (2.4% of the
genome); 1,027 RepeatMasker features (annotated with the [RepBase
library](http://www.girinst.org/repbase/)), covering 0 Mb (0.1% of the
genome); 19,602 RepeatMasker features (annotated with the [PGSB-REdat
library](http://pgsb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plant/recat/)), covering 6 Mb
(5.7% of the genome); 28,669 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 3
Mb (2.7% of the genome).
