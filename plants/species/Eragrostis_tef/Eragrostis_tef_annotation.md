### Annotation

Genes were annotated by the Tef Improvement Project using RNA-Seq data,
a normalized transcriptome and UniProt monocots in combination with
Augustus and SNAP in the Maker pipeline. Currently contains 41,555
protein-coding genes.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 197140097 - Repeats content: 32.5%
