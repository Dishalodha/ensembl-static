### Variation

Variation data comes from two (unpublished) sources:

1.  20 diverse accessions of *Oryza glaberrima* and
2.  19 accessions of its wild progenitor, *Oryza barthii*, collected
    from geographically distributed regions of Africa.

Briefly, WGS reads were generated using low-coverage
[Illumina](http://www.illumina.com) sequencing. Filtered reads were
aligned to O. glaberrima using
[BWA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19451168) and SNP calling was
done using a combination of
[SAMtools](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19505943) and
[GATK](http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk) with standard quality and
coverage filters giving a final set of \~8 million SNPs.

These unpublished data were kindly contributed by Rod Wing of the
[Arizona Genomics Institute](http://www.genome.arizona.edu) and
collaborator [Carlos
Machado](http://biology.umd.edu/faculty/carlosamachado) of the
[University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu), as part of the Oryza
Genome Evolution project funded by [NSF Award
\#1026200](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1026200).
