### Annotation

Gene annotation was carried out by the [WEWseq
Consortium](https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28684525). RNA sequencing
reads generated from 20 different combinations of WEW tissues and
developmental stages were used to annotate protein-coding genes in the
WEW assembly (13). 65,012 high-confidence (HC) gene models were
identified, and validation with the BUSCO gene set indicated that the
assembly captured 98.4% of the WEW gene complement. 45,532 Low
confidence genes where discovered as well and shown on a seperate track.
