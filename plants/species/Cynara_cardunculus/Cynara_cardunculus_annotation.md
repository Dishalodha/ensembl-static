### Annotation

Gene prediction utilized reiterative runs of the MAKER suite. Both EST
sequences and RNAseq data were used to guide gene annotation. The
annotation pipeline yielded 26,889 gene models (and a total of 27,121
predicted transcripts), of which 23,895 were located in the chromosomal
pseudomolecules.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 354774964 - Repeats content: 48.9%
