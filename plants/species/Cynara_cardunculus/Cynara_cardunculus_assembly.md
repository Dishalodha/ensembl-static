### Assembly

Clone 2C, obtained by three cycles of selfing (S3) and with a residual
heterozygosity of approximately 10%, was used to prepare one paired-end
(PE) and two mate-pair (MP) libraries consistent with requirements of
ALLPATHS-LG. The 100 + 100 bp PE reads had an average insert size of 170
bp and produced 67 Gb of raw data (equivalent to an estimated genome
coverage of 62x). The sequencing of the two MP libraries, with average
effective insert sizes of 2.5 Kb and 5.5 Kb, produced 56 Gb and 7 Gb of
raw data, respectively (corresponding to 52x and 6.5x genome coverages).
The resulting assembly comprised 13,588 scaffolds covering 725 of the
1,084 Mb genome (N50=1,408 and L50=125.9 Kb). Re-sequencing (30x) of
globe artichoke and cultivated cardoon (C. cardunculus var. altilis)
parental genotypes and low-coverage (0.5 to 1x) genotyping-by-sequencing
of 163 F1 individuals resulted in 73% of the assembled genome being
anchored in 2,178 genetic bins ordered along 17 chromosomal
pseudomolecules. This was achieved using pipeline SOILoCo (Scaffold
Ordering by Imputation with Low Coverage).
