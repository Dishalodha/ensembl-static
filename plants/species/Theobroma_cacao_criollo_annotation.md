### Annotation

V1 gene annotations produced by EUGene, following specific training for
*T. cacao*, were combined with a new, de novo RefSeq structural
annotation performed by the NCBI Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline
based on RNAseq evidence. 98.6% of the V1 gene models were relocated to
the V2 assembly. In total 345 genes from V1 were relocated to a
different chromosome in V2. A consensus annotation to select the best
structural predictions between both datasets was performed, yielding
29,071 consensus protein coding gene models.
