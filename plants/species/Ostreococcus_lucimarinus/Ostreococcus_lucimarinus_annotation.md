### Annotation

This release includes a total of 7,651 predicted gene models produced
through the collaboration of JGI, Ghent University (Belgium) and UCSD
annotation teams.

[In detail](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17460045), gene prediction
methods included *ab initio* Fgenesh, Fgenesh+, Genewise, MAGPIE,
estExt, and EuGene. All predicted models were clustered and the best
model per locus was selected based on homology to other proteins and EST
support. The predicted set of gene models has been validated by using
available experimental data and computational analysis.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 5898261 - Repeats content: 44.7%
