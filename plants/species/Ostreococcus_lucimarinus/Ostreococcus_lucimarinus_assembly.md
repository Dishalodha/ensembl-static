### Assembly

The genome of *Ostreococcus lucimarinus* CCE9901 was sequenced by JGI
and finished at the Stanford Genome Center. The v2.0 release has
13.204,894 Mb of finished sequence. The sequences have been deposited in
GenBank under accession numbers CP000581-CP000601. Detailed information
about the project is availabe at the
[JGI](http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Ost9901_3/Ost9901_3.info.html) website.

The assembly release v.2.0 contains 13,204,894 bp of finished quality
sequence in 21 chromosomes.

[In detail](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17460045), whole genome
shotgun Sanger sequences were assembled using the Phred, Phrap, Consed
pipeline. Manual inspection and finishing was performed by targeted
resequencing. Because of the high GC content, primer walks failed to
resolve a large number of the gaps; these were resolved by generating
pooled small insert shatter libraries from 3 kb plasmid clones. Repeats
were resolved by transposon-hopping 8 kb plasmid clones. Fosmid clones
were shotgun-sequenced and finished to fill large gaps, resolve large
repeats, or resolve chromosome duplications and extend into chromosome
telomere regions. Finished chromosomes have no gaps, and the sequence
has less than one error in 100,000 bp.
