About *Gossypium raimondii*
---------------------------

*Gossypium raimondii* is a species of cotton plant endemic to northern
Peru. The Gossypium genus is ideal for i[nvestigating emergent
consequences of polyploidy](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23257886).
A-genome diploids native to Africa and Mexican D-genome diploids
diverged ∼5--10 Myr ago. They were reunited ∼1--2 Myr ago by
trans-oceanic dispersal of a maternal A-genome propagule resembling *G.
herbaceum* to the New World, hybridisation with a native D-genome
species resembling *G. raimondii*, and chromosome doubling. The nascent
AtDt allopolyploid spread throughout the American tropics and
subtropics, diverging into at least five species; two of these species
(*G. hirsutum* and G. *barbadense*) were independently domesticated to
spawn one of the world's largest industries (textiles) and become a
major oilseed.
