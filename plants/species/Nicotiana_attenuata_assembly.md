### Assembly

The sequencing of the genome of *N. attenuata* was done by the [Max
Planck Institute for Chemical
Ecology](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28536194), using 30Ã— Illumina
short reads, 4.5x 454 reads, and 10x PacBio single-molecule long reads.
It was then assembled into 2.37 Gb of sequences representing 92% of the
expected genome size. From this was generated a 50x optical map and a
high-density linkage map for super-scaffolding, which anchored 825.8 Mb
to 12 linkage groups and resulted in a final assembly with a N50 contig
equal to 90.4 kb and a scaffold size of 524.5 kb.
