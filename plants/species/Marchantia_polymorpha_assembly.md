The nuclear and organellar genomes of *M. polymorpha* subspecies
ruderalis were sequenced using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing
strategy with 27x mean coverage. A a single clonal female derived from
backcross 4 between a male Tak-1 line and a female Tak-2 line, whose X
chromosome was introgressed into a largely Tak-1 autosomal background.
Nuclear genome v 3.1 assembly consists of 2,957 scaffolds (4,454
contigs) covering 225.8 Mb.
