### Annotation

Gene prediction of the assembled genomic scaffolds has been conducted by
CAAS-IVF using GLEAN and BLAT. Functional annotation for the gene models
is provided through similarity to *Arabidopsis thaliana* genes
(E=1e^-5^) and Gene Ontology terms are provided through significant
similarity to UniProtKB proteins (E=1e^-5^).
