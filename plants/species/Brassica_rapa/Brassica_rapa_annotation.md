### Annotation

Gene prediction of the assembled genomic scaffolds has been conducted by
CAAS-IVF using GLEAN and BLAT. Functional annotation for the gene models
is provided through similarity to *Arabidopsis thaliana* genes
(E=1e^-5^) and Gene Ontology terms are provided through significant
similarity to UniProtKB proteins (E=1e^-5^).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There are: 655,980 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 33 Mb (11.8% of the genome); 209,256 RepeatMasker features (with the nrplants library), covering 88 Mb (31.1% of the genome); 118,356 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library), covering 32 Mb (11.4% of the genome); 145,117 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 14 Mb (4.8% of the genome).
