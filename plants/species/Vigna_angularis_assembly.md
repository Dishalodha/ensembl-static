### Assembly

This assembly comes from the [Beijing University of
Agriculture](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/25626881). Paired-end
(180 bp) and mate-pair (5 and 10 kb) libraries were prepared using 100
bp short reads (Illumina HiSeq 2000) and were combined with a single
unpaired library of average read length of 458 bp (Roche GS-FLX+) for a
total physical coverage of 291x. The assembly produced 3,883 scaffolds
with N50 length of 703â€…kb, covering 75% of the estimated genome size.
Scaffolds were assembled into pseudo-molecules using synteny and genetic
mapping of a population of 133 F4 lines (814 SNPs in 11 linkage groups).
