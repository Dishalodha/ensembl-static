About *Quercus suber*
---------------------

Quercus suber is an evergreen tree, commonly known as cork oak, which is native to the western Mediterranean Basin, especially southwest Europe, where it occurs in the coastal regions. Cork oak has the rare characteristic of producing a continuous and renewable cork layer, which has fine physical and chemical properties that make it highly profitable for industrial uses.
