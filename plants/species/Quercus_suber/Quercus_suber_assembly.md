### Assembly

The genome size of cork oak, a diploid (2n=24) species, was estimated, using flow cytometry, to be 934 Mb. In the present study we a combination of Paired-End (PE) and Mate-Pair (MP) libraries sequenced were used using the Illumina platform to generate a draft genome assembly with an estimated genome size of 953.3 Mb, which is a very close match to the previous estimate. The bioinformatics pipeline involved a de novo genome assembly step, followed by scaffolding, gap filling and removal of heterozygous regions. The cork oak draft genome is distributed over 23,344 scaffolds, even though the vast majority of the assembly is represented in a considerable smaller number of larger scaffolds (approximately 94.6% of the assembled genome present in the 4,730 scaffolds longer than 10,000 bp).
