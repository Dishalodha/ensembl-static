### Variation

The variation data for Solanum lycopersicum is from the study of
[genetic variation by whole-genome
sequencing](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/25039268) of 84 tomato
cultivars, including cultivated wild relatives representative of the
Lycopersicon, Arcanum, Eriopersicon and Neolycopersicon group. In
detail, the study expored genetic variation in the tomato clade by
sequencing a selection of 84 tomato cultivars and related wild species
representative for the Lycopersicon, Arcanum, Eriopersicon and
Neolycopersicon groups. The variation data has been submitted to the ENA
with accession
[ERP004618](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERP004618), and has been
locus-level accessioned using [the transPLANT variation
archive](http://www.transplantdb.eu/variation/intro).
