### Assembly

*Solanum lycopersicum* cv. Heinz 1706 was sequenced and assembled by the
International Tomato Genome Sequencing Consortium. Assembly version
SL3.0 combines whole genome shotgun sequence (Roche 454) with Sanger
sequence data from BAC-ends, fosmid-ends and Selected BAC Mixture
sequences, additional data from Solexa and SOLiD technologies and optic
mapping (total genome coverage 27X). The assembly is deposited into
DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession
[GCA\_000188115.3](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000188115.3).
