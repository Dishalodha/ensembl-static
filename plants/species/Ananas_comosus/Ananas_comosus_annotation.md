### Annotation

MAKER was used for gene annotation, obtaining 27,024 gene models, 89% of
which were categorized as complete. In total 10,151 alternative splicing
events were identified, with intron retention accounting for 62.8%.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines]http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 126480149 - Repeats content: 40.04%
