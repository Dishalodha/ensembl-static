About *Daucus carota subsp. sativus*
------------------------------------

Carrot is a globally important root crop whose production has quadrupled
between 1976 and 2013, outpacing the overall rate of increase in
vegetable production and world population growth through development of
high-value products for fresh consumption, juices, and natural pigments
and cultivars adapted to warmer production regions.
