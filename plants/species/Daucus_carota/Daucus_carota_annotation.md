### Annotation

In the gene annotation carreid out by the [United States Department of
Agriculture](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27158781), 32,113 genes
were predicted, of which 79% had substantial homology with known genes.
The majority (98.7%) of gene predictions had supporting cDNA and/or EST
evidence, demonstrating the high accuracy of gene prediction. Relative
to five other closely related genomes, carrot was enriched for genes
involved in a wide range of molecular functions. 564 tRNAs, 31 rRNA
fragments, 532 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, and 248 microRNAs
(miRNAs) were also identified, distributed among 46 families.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 144037532 - Repeats content: 34.2%
