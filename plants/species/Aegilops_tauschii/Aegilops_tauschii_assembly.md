### Assembly

The Ae. tauschii AL8/78 genome sequence was assembled in five steps. The
core was assembly Aet v1.1 based on sequences of 42,822 bacterial
artificial chromosome (BAC) clones. This assembly was merged with a
whole-genome shotgun (WGS) assembly (Aet WGS 1.0) and WGS Pacific
Biosciences mega-reads6 to extend scaffolds and close gaps, thereby
producing assembly Aet v2.0. Misassembled scaffolds were detected with
the aid of an AL8/78 optical BioNano genome (BNG) map and resolved,
producing assembly Aet v3.0. Two additional BNG maps were constructed
and, along with the genetic and physical maps7, used in
super-scaffolding and building pseudomolecules for the final assembly,
Aet v4.0. \[1\]
