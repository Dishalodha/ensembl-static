### Annotation

83,117 genes were annotated in Aet v4.0 and 39,622 were allocated into
the high-confidence class (HCC) (gene set v2.0). The remaining 43,495
were allocated into the low-confidence class (LCC). Of the HCC genes,
38,775 were in the pseudomolecules and 847 (2.2%) were in unassigned
scaffolds. The total length of predicted HCC genes was 316,517,346 bp
(7.5%) and the total length of their mRNAs was 145,062,217 bp (3.4%).
Gene annotation was validated by a search for 1,440 BUSCO genes19, of
which 1,408 (97.8%) were correctly predicted among the 83,117 genes. Ae.
tauschii genes were compared with genes annotated in four grass genomes
and the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Ae. tauschii genes were the
longest, had the longest mean exon length, and together with barley
genes had the longest transcript lengths among the genomes. Otherwise,
they were similar to genes in the other genomes, except for having a
lower average number of exons.\[1\]
