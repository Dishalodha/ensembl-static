About *Aegilops tauschii*
-------------------------

Tausch\'s goatgrass or rough-spike hard grass (*Aegilops tauschii*) is
found in temperate Asia and the Caucasus region. It is the diploid
progenitor of the [bread
wheat](/triticum_aestivum "Triticum aestivum in Ensembl Plants")
(*Triticum aestivum*) D-genome, providing important evolutionary
information for wheat. The bread wheat genome is a hexaploid, resulting
from the hybridisation of the wild *A. tauschii* with a cultivated
tetraploid wheat, [*Triticum dicoccoides*](/Triticum_dicoccoides). This
spontaneous event occured about 8,000 years ago in the [Fertile
Crescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertile_Crescent).
