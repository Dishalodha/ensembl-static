### Annotation

The annotation presented is derived from annotation submitted to
[INSDC](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/insdc_annotation) with the assembly accession
[GCA\_000341285.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000341285.1),
with additional non-coding genes derived from
[Rfam](http://rfam.xfam.org/).

Repeats were annotated in-house with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: 9,272 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 0 Mb (3.6% of the
genome); 251 RepeatMasker features (annotated with the [RepBase
library](http://www.girinst.org/repbase/)), covering 0 Mb (0.3% of the
genome); 1,654 RepeatMasker features (annotated with the [PGSB-REdat
library](http://pgsb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plant/recat/)), covering 0 Mb
(1.5% of the genome); 1,406 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 0 Mb
(1.0% of the genome); Repeat Detector repeats length 2.3Mb (17.1% of the genome).
