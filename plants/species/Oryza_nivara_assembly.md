### Assembly

The genome sequence was generated and assembled by the [Arizona Genomics
Institute (AGI)](https://www.genome.arizona.edu/) using accession
IRGC100897. Illumina reads of different library sizes were assembled
with Allpaths-LG, scaffolds were constructed with SSPACE, and gaps were
closed with GapFiller. The estimated coverage from the WGS was 102x.
Total sequence length 337,950,324 bp; Number of contigs 16,484; Contig
N50: 37,688 bp.
