in South America. It is the most economically important plant in the
family Bromeliaceae. Ananas is unique in the family for its syncarpic
fruit; in fact it means 'excellent fruit' in Guaran√≠ language. Pineapple
was domesticated over 6 thousand years ago and distributed to
Mesoamerica over 2,500 years ago. Cultivated pineapple is a clonally
propagated, self-incompatible diploid (2n=2x=50) with CAM
