### Assembly

Four Illumina large insert size mate paired libraries wew combined with
52x of Pacific Biosciences long reads to correct misassembled regions
and reduced the number of scaffolds. In addition, genotyping by
sequencing SNPs from a UF676 x ICS95 mapping population of 434
individuals were used to increase the proportion of the assembly
anchored to chromosomes. The scaffold number decreased from 4,792 in
assembly V1 to 554 in V2 while the scaffold N50 size increased from 0.47
Mb in V1 to 6.5 Mb. A total of 96.7% of the assembly was anchored to the
10 chromosomes. Unknown sites (Ns) were reduced from 10.8% to 5.7%. This
assembly was produced by the [Cocoa Genome
Hub](http://cocoa-genome-hub.southgreen.fr).
