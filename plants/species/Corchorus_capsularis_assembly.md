### Assembly

Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed using Roche/454 GS FLX and
was assembled using CABOG (version 7) by the [Bangladesh Jute Research
Institute](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28134914). A total of 13.69
Gb of sequence data was generated (\~30x), consisting of 7.87 Gb of
shotgun sequences (\~20x), 2.04 Gb of 3-kb paired-end sequences (14x
physical coverage), 2.26 Gb of 8-kb paired-end sequences (15x physical
coverage), and 1.51 Gb of 20-kb paired-end sequences (11x physical
coverage). The resulting assembly was 338 Mb in 6,125 scaffolds with a
scaffold N50 of 4.1 Mb. 80% of the assembly was covered with 231
scaffolds (minimum length 120 kb).
