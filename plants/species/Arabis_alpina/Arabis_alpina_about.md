--------------------------

*Arabis alpina*, the Alpine rock-cress (2n=16), is a close relative of *Arabidopsis thaliana* belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is a perennial model organism. Since it is self-compatible and genetically transformable, mutagenized populations and inbred homozygous lines can be produced. A. alpina belongs to the tribe Arabideae, in which several perennial and annual species can be found.
