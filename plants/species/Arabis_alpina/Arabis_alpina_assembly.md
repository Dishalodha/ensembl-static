The reference accession Pajares was collected in the Cordillera Cant√°brica mountain system in Spain and was afterwards self-fertilized for 6 generations by single-seed descent. Its haploid genome was sequenced following a hybrid approach using 454 shotgun and 454 and Illumina paired-end sequencing with 12 kb, 3 kb and 500 bp insert size libraries. In addition, 21Mb of Sanger sequenced BAC ends were produced. The genome size estimated by flow cytometry was 375 Mb. A 309 Mb assembly was produced with 38,819 scaffolds, N50 of 788Kb and L50 of 160Kb. Comparative chromosome painting (CCP) revealed conserved order of large genomic regions with *A. thaliana* enabling an additional, synteny-based scaffolding into eight pseudo-molecules containing 88% of the genes.
