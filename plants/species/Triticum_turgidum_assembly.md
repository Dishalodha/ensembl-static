The Svevo genome sequence was assembled de novo using protocols
previously used for wild Emmer Wheat \[2\]. After sequencing and
assembly, the scaffolds (length of the shortest contig needed to cover
50% of the genome (N50) = 6.0 megabases (Mb)) were ordered and oriented
using the Svevo × Zavitan genetic map \[3\]. Thereafter, chromosome
conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C) resulted in a set of
pseudomolecules (9.96 Gb) corresponding to the 14 chromosomes of the
genome and one group of unassigned scaffolds (499 Mb). The
pseudomolecules encompass 95.3% of the assembled sequences and have 90%
of the scaffolds oriented \[1\].
