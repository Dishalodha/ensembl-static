Bread wheat or common wheat (*Triticum aestivum*) is a major worldwide
cereal grain which is essential to human food. Wheat was one of the
first cereals to be domesticated, and is thought to have originated in
the fertile crescent around 9000 years B.C.

Bread wheat species is hexaploid, and its genome size is estimated at
17Gbp. It is composed of three closely-related and independently
maintained genomes. Bread wheat is the result of a series of
hybridization events that are thought to have occurred naturally. The
ancestral progenitor genomes are considered to be *Triticum urartu* (the
A genome donor), and an unknown grass, but thought to be closely related
to *Aegilops speltoides* (the B genome donor). This first hybridization
event produced tetraploid emmer wheat (AABB, *T. dicoccoides*), which
then hybridized with a diploid goat grass (DD, *Aegilops tauschii*).
