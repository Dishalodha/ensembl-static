### Assembly

An individual of cultivar Batoury was chosen for genome sequencing and
assembly. The genome was sequenced with the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform
from multiple paired-end libraries, including two small-insert libraries
(270 bp and 500 bp) and six long-insert mate-pair libraries (3 kb, 4 kb,
8 kb, 10 kb, 15 kb, and 17 kb), achieving 270.47X coverage. A draft
genome of 569.12 Mb was assembled, with contig and scaffold N50 sizes of
20.69 kb and 768.39 kb, respectively. To improve the continuity, a total
of 4,038,150 filtered long reads were generated, with average lengths of
14,568 bp from 59 Gb sequencing data by Pacbio Sequel System. Finally, a
draft genome of 671 Mb was assembled, with contig and scaffold N50 sizes
of 75.7 kb and 949.2 kb, respectively provided a total of 373.84X
coverage. The completeness of the genome assembly was confirmed by CEGMA
and BUSCO software.
