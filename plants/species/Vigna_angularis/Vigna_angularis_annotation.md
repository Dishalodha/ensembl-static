### Annotation

Gene prediction using the MAKER pipeline revealed 26,857 high confidence
protein-coding genes using RNA-seq of flower, pod, leaf, and root
tissues. In total, 86% of the 248 core eukaryotic genes in CEGMA
pipeline were matched to the genome assembly.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 179149622 - Repeats content: 38.4%
