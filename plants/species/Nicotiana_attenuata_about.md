About *Nicotiana attenuata*
---------------------------

*Nicotiana attenuata* is a species of wild diploid tobacco, known as
coyote tobacco, which is native to North America. While used for
medicinal and ceremonial purposes by some Native Americans, it is not a
commercial tobacco plant.

The pyridine alkaloid nicotine, whose addictive properties are well
known to humans, is the signature compound of the genus Nicotiana
(Solanaceae). In nature, nicotine is arguably one of the most broadly
effective plant defence metabolites, in that it poisons acetylcholine
receptors and is thereby toxic to all heterotrophs with neuromuscular
junctions. [Field studies using genetically
modified](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28536194) *Nicotiana
attenuata* (coyote tobacco) plants, have revealed that this toxin
fulfills multifaceted ecological functions that contribute to plant
fitness.
