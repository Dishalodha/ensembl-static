### Annotation

The genome annotation for Cyanidioschyzon merolae has been imported from
[Cyanidioschyzon merolae Genome
project](http://merolae.biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/intro_menu.html) by mapping
cDNA clones using BLAST and *ab initio* prediction of ORFs by searching
known motifs and domains.

Additional analysis was carried out in house: non coding RNA genes have
been annotated using
[tRNAScan-SE](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC146525),
[Rfam](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15608160), and
[RNAmmer](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1888812).

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 4384488 - Repeats content: 26.2%
