### Annotation

Mapping of transcriptome data and reference protein sequences from other
plant species identified 83,105 putative gene loci including protein
coding genes, non-coding RNAs, pseudogenes and transcribed transposons.
These loci were filtered and divided into 39,734 high-confidence and
41,949 low-confidence genes based on sequence homology. Additionally
19,908 long non-coding RNAs and 792 microRNA precursor loci were
predicted. Using a set of conserved eukaryotic core genes
([BUSCO](http://busco.ezlab.org/ "Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs")),
it was estimated that the predicted gene models represent 98% of the cv.
Morex barley gene complement.
