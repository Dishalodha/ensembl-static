About *Dioscorea rotundata*
---------------------------

White Guinea yam (*Dioscorea rotundata* Poir.) is a common staple food
that has contributed enormously to the subsistence and socio-cultural
life of millions of people principally in West and Central Africa.
Belonging to the monocotyledon the Dioscorea genus, under the family
Dioscoreaceae, there are about 450 known species mainly distributed in
tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The entire Genus is
characterised by the occurrence of separate male and female plants
(dioecy), a rare trait in angiosperms that has limited efficient
breeding, and *D. rotundata* can be either diploid or triploid, with a
haploid chromosome number of 20.. The reference for *D. rotundata* comes
from a diploid individual of unknown sex with an assembled genome size
of 594 Mb.
