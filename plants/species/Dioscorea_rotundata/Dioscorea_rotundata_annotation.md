### Annotation

The Iwate Biotechnology Research Center generated gene models using TACO,
which is a software for RNA-seq-based gene prediction. TACO predicted 25,708 
gene models using RNA-seqs from 15 different D. rotundata tissues. In addition, 
the gene models predicted in the previous study (1) were mapped to the new 
reference genome by Spaln2, and 8,884 gene models which did overlap with the new 
gene models were added to the new reference genome. Open reading frames were 
predicted by InterProScan. These were functionally annotated using Pfam protein 
family database through InterProScan and BLAST+ to the database of Viridiplantae 
from UniProt.

Repeats were annotated with the <a href='http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html'>Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline</a>. There are: 1,219,329 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 50 Mb (8.6% of the genome); 261,748 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), covering 77 Mb (13.2% of the genome); 401,558 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 35 Mb (6.0% of the genome).
