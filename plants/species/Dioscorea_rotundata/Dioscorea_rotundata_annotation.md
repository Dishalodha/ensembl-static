### Annotation

The [Iwate Biotechnology Research
Center](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5604175) generated gene models
using MAKER, with publicly available homologous EST and protein
sequences from related species, and assembled transcripts generated
using RNA-seq from 18 different *D. rotundata* tissues. An initial MAKER
set of gene models was combined with a legacy AUGUSTUS annotation using
JIGSAW to produce 26,198 gene models. These were functionally annotated
using BLAST2GO and InterProSCANi.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/repeat_features). There
are: 8,371 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library), covering 1
Mb (0.2% of the genome); 918,128 Low complexity (Dust) features,
covering 83 Mb (18.2% of the genome); 193,894 RepeatMasker features
(with the [reDAT
library](http://pgsb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plant/recat/)), covering 58
Mb (12.8% of the genome); 281,939 Tandem repeats (TRF) features,
covering 22 Mb (4.9% of the genome).
