About *Glycine max*
-------------------

*Glycine max* (soybean) is a crop legume that globally constitutes one
of the most important sources of animal feed protein and cooking oil.
Having originated in East Asia soy is now cultivated world-wide with
greatest production in the U.S. Though only a minor proportion of the
crop is eaten directly by humans, soybean is a valuable source of
protein, containing all essential amino acids, and frequently used as a
dietary substitute for meat. Like other legumes, soybean is able to fix
atmospheric nitrogen by engaging in a symbiotic relationship with
microbial organisms. The complete sequence of the soybean genome not
only impacts research and breeding of this crop, but also serves as a
reference for genomics research in other legumes. Representing the order
Fabales within the eudicot taxonomy, the sequence will also advance
research in comparative phylogenomics. As a paleopolyploid, the soybean
genome shows evidence of two ancient whole genome duplications, one
early in the legume lineage and a second more recent event specific to
the soybean lineage. The soybean genome has 20 chromosomes and an
estimated size of 1,115 Mb.
