### Annotation

*N. attenuata* gene annotation was combined with that of *N.
obtusifolia* integrating both hint-guided AUGUSTUS and MAKER2 gene
prediction pipelines predicted 33,449 gene models in the *N. attenuata*
genome. More than 71% of these gene models were fully supported by
RNA-seq reads and 12,617 and 18,176 of these genes are orthologous to
*Arabidopsis* and tomato genes, respectively.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 1551386522 - Repeats content: 65.6%
