Gene annotation was performed with AUGUSTUS v3.0.3 using RNA-seq data
from leaves and roots (see Paape *et al*. 2016). Human readable
functional descriptions were generated with AHRD. Out of 32,553 genes,
21,433 were reciprocal best blast hits with *Arabidopsis thaliana*
TAIR10 genes.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 61005460 - Repeats content: 31.1%
