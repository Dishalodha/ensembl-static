Genomic DNA was extracted from plants obtained after five rounds of
forced selfing, with heterozygosity reduced to 0.04%. The genome was
assembled using ALLPATHS-LG R50599 using three paired end short insert
libraries (200 bp, 500 bp, and 800 bp, see Akama *et al*. 2014) and six
long insert mate pair libraries (ranging from 3 kb to 38 kb). The
assembly was subsequently improved based on synteny with *Arabidopsis
lyrata* assembly.
