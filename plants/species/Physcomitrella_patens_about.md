About *Physcomitrella patens*
-----------------------------

The mosses (*Bryophytes*) are non-vascular plants that appeared very
early in the fossil record, soon after the transition of plants to
terrestrial environments. The *Physcomitrella patens* genome is
therefore valuable in understanding early evolution and adaptation of
land plants. Physcomitrella also serves as a model organism for studies
of physiology and development. Unlike in higher plants, targeted gene
knockouts can be made efficiently in the laboratory, thereby
facilitating reverse-genetics approaches to studying gene function. The
annotated genome hosted here thereby represents an important resource to
the plant research community.
