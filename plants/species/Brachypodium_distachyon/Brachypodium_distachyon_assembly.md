### Assembly

This release represents the second improved *Brachypodium distachyon*
(Bd21 strain) genome including \~270 Mb of improved Brachypodium
sequence, from
[JGI](https://jgi.doe.gov/our-science/science-programs/plant-genomics/brachypodium/).
These regions were improved by dividing the gene space into \~2Mb
overlapping pieces. Each region was manually inspected and then finished
using a variety of technologies including Sanger (primer walks on
subclones and fosmid templates, transposon sequencing on subclone
templates), Illumina (small insert shatter libraries) and clone-based
shotgun sequencing using both Sanger and Illumina libraries. 1,496 gaps
were closed, and a total of 1.43 Mb was added to the assembly. Overall
contiguity (contig N50) increased by a factor of 63 from 347.8 kb to 22
Mb.
