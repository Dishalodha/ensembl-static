About *Brachypodium distachyon*
-------------------------------

*Brachypodium distachyon*, like *[Arabidopsis
thaliana](/Arabidopsis_thaliana "Arabidopsis thaliana in Ensembl Plants")*,
has several features that recommend it as a model plant for functional
genomic studies, especially in the grasses. It has a small, diploid
genome (\~355 Mb), small physical size, a short life-cycle and few
growth requirements. Brachypodium is related to the major cereal grain
species but is understood to be more closely related to the Triticeae
([wheat](/Triticum_aestivum "Triticum aestivum in Ensembl Plants") and
[barley](/Hordeum_vulgare "Hordeum vulgare in Ensembl Plants")) than to
the other cereals.
