### Annotation

74,756 transcript assemblies were constructed from 160 million
paired-end Illumina RNA-seq reads, 17,647 transcript assemblies from
\~1.9 million 454 reads. The transcript assemblies from RNA-seq reads
were made using PERTRAN. 76,209 transcript assemblies were constructed
using PASA from 314,866 sequences in total, consisting of the RNA-seq
transcript assemblies above, as well as Sanger ESTs. Loci were
determined by transcript assembly alignments and/or EXONERATE alignments
of proteins from arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice, sorghum,
foxtail, grape, soybean and Swiss-Prot eukaryote proteins to
soft-repeatmasked *Brachypodium distachyon* Bd21 genome using
RepeatMasker with up to 2 kb extension on both ends unless extending
into another locus on the same strand. Gene models were predicted by
homology-based predictors, FGENESH+, FGENESH\_EST (similar to FGENESH+,
EST as splice site and intron input instead of protein/translated ORF),
and GenomeScan.

The end result was 34,310 loci containing protein-coding transcripts and
52,972 protein-coding transcripts
