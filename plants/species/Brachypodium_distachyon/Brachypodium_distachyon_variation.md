### Variation

#### *Brachypodium* variation data

Approximately [394,000 genetic
variants](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4105277) have been identified
by the alignment of transcriptome assemblies from three slender false
brome (*Brachypodium sylvaticum*) populations. Two populations come from
*B. sylvaticum*\'s native range (Greece and Spain) and one comes from
its invasive range (Oregon). Both the transciptome alignments and
variation data are available in Ensembl Plants.

#### Wheat inter-homoeologous variants

As part of the wheat genome analysis, we have aligned a set of
[*Triticum
aestivum*](/triticum_aestivum "Triticum aestivum in Ensembl Plants")
(bread wheat) homoeologous SNPs (SNPs between the component A, B, and D
genomes of wheat) against the *Brachypodium distachyon* genome. SNPs
have been classified into two groups, 1) SNPs that differ between the A
and D genomes (where the B genome is unknown) and, 2) SNPs that are the
same between the A and D genomes, but differ in B.

The wheat sequence alignments and the projected homoeologous SNPs are
available as tracks under the \"Wheat SNPs and alignments\" section of
the \"Configure this page\" menu.
