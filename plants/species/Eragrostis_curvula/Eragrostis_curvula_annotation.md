### Annotation

Gene annotation was performed using an ab initio prediction algorithm
combined with data from ESTs and RNA-seq databases from different
tissues of E. curvula and from proteins of related species. After three
iterations of the MAKER software, near 56K gene models were obtained
with an average size of 1,424 bp and 93.4% of the complete BUSCO genes.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: 703004 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 18 Mb (3.0% of the
genome); 279122 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat library), covering
102 Mb (16.9% of the genome); 5846 RepeatMasker features (with the
RepBase library), covering 1 Mb (0.1% of the genome); 242601 Tandem
repeats (TRF) features, covering 26 Mb (4.3% of the genome);
Repeat Detector repeats length 224Mb (37.2% of the genome).
