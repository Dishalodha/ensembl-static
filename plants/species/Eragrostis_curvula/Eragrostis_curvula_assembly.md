### Assembly

The cultivar selected was a sexual diploid (620 Mb haplotype) originated
from in vitro culture of inflorescences of the apomictic cv. Tanganyika
(2n=4x=40). The sequencing was done with the PacBio Sequel platform.
After a preliminary assembly one Dovetail Chicago and one Dovetail Hi-C
library were added, obtaining chromosomes size contigs covering 95% of
the diploid genome. The final assembly N50 was 43.41 Mb and the number
of scaffolds 1,143. The final BUSCO results were 96.4% (80.3% single
copy and 16.1% were duplicated).
