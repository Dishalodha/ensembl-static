### Annotation

Protein-coding genes, annotation of repeats and transposable elements
were conducted at Arizona Genomics Institute (AGI) led by Dr. Rod Wing.
MAKER-P was used as evidence-based genome annotation pipeline.
RepeatMasker was used to annotate repeats and transposable elements
using species-specific de novo repeat libraries. Non coding RNA genes
were predicted by AGI with Infernal, tRNA genes with tRNAScan.
