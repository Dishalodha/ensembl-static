### Annotation

Over 25K protein-coding genes were predicted by ab initio and homology-based analyses, 
together with RNA-Seq reads-assisted annotation. 
Of those, 87.1% were supported by unigenes or protein similarity.

Repeats were annotated with Repeat Detector and the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html).There are: 564818 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 26 Mb (9.5% of the genome); 102524 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), covering 26 Mb (9.4% of the genome); 132402 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 18 Mb (6.4% of the genome).
