About *Sesamum indicum*
-----------------------

Sesame, *Sesamum indicum*, is considered the queen of oilseeds for its high oil content and quality, 
and is grown widely in tropical and subtropical areas as an important source of oil and protein. 
Compared to other edible oil crops such as soybean, rapeseed, peanut and olive, sesame has innately 
higher oil content and is thus an attractive potential model for studying lipid biosynthesis.
Cultivated sesame is a self-pollinated diploid (2n=26), with an estimated genome size of 337-357Mbp,
that belongs to the family Pedaliaceae and order Lamiales. Lamiales is one of the largest orders of 
flowering plants, with representatives found all over the world, including members such as olive, 
lavender and mint. This sequence is of inbreed genotype Zhongzhi No. 13.
