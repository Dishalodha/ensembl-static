### Assembly

A total of 54.5 Gb of high-quality data were obtained using the Illumina Hiseq2000 platform (153x).
SOAPdenovo was used to assemble the genome, which resulted in a draft genome of 274 Mb with contig 
N50 of 52.2 kb and scaffold N50 of 2.1 Mb. Using a genetic map consisting of 406 markers, 
150 large scaffolds (117 oriented) were anchored into 16 pseudomolecules, which harbor 85.3% of the 
genome assembly and 91.7% of the predicted genes.  

The assembly covered 77.4-81.3% of the genome size. The integrity of gene space in the genome assembly 
was demonstrated by the successful mapping of 99.3% of 3,328 expressed sequence tags retrieved from GenBank, 
and 98.5% of 86,222 unigenes assembled de novo from previously reported RNA-Seq data. In addition, 
the large-scale assembly accuracy was assessed using five fosmid clones that were sequenced thoroughly using 
the Sanger sequencing technology, whereby 99.6% of the clone sequences, on average, were identical to the assembly.
