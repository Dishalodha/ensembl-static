### Assembly

DNA was extracted from leaves collected from trees in the Orhangazi
region of Bursa city (Turkey). The genome was shotgun-sequenced (220x
coverage), generating 515.7 Gbp of data. SOAPdenovo was used to assemble
the sequence reads, which resulted in a draft genome assembly of 1.48
Gbp, with the scaffold shortest sequence length at 50% of the genome of
228 kbp, which is in agreement with genome size estimations from flow
cytometry and k-mer analysis (∼1.46 Gbp). By using genetic maps with
1,307 markers, 50% of sequences longer than 1 kbp (∼572 Mbp) could be
anchored into 23 linkage groups.
