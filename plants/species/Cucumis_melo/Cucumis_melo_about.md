About *Cucumis melo*
--------------------

*Cucumis melo* (melon) is a eudicot diploid plant species (2n=2x=24) of interest for its specific biological properties and for its economic importance. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which also includes cucumber, watermelon and squash. Although originally thought to originate in Africa, recent data suggest that melon and cucumber may be of Asian origin. Melon is an attractive model for studying fruit ripening, sex determination and phloem physiology. It is also an important fruit crop, particularly in Mediterranean and East Asian countries, where hybrid varieties have a significant and growing economic value. This is a project of the Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics CSIC-IRTA-UAB-UB.
