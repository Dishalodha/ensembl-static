### Annotation

Gene annotation was performed by transferring through a liftover process the latest published gene models to the new PacBio-based genome assembly using Maker v2. Completeness analysis reported 91.1% of complete and 2.4% fragmented BUSCOs at the gene model level.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There are: 840,447 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 33 Mb (9.2% of the genome); 102,852 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat library), covering 41 Mb (11.3% of the genome); 34,086 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library), covering 22 Mb (6.2% of the genome); 296,952 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 27 Mb (7.4% of the genome).
