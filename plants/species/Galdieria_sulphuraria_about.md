About *Galdieria sulphuraria*
-----------------------------

*Galdieria sulphuraria* is an extremophilic unicellular species of red
algae. It is the type species of the genus Galdieria. It is known for
its broad metabolic capacities, including photosynthesis and
heterotrophic growth on over 50 different extracellular carbon sources.
The members of the Cyanidiophyceae family are among the most acidophilic
known photosynthetic organisms, and the growth conditions of *G.
sulphuraria*, pH between 0 and 4, and temperatures up to 56Â°C, are among
the most extreme known for eukaryotes. Analysis of its genome suggests
that its thermoacidophilic adaptations derive from horizontal gene
transfer from archaea and bacteria, another rarity among eukaryotes.
