About *Helianthus annuus*
-------------------------

The domesticated sunflower, *Helianthus annuus*, is a globally important
oil crop that has promise for climate change adaptation, maintaining
stable yields across a wide variety of environmental conditions,
including drought. The large diploid genome (2n=34 ; 3.6 Gb) consists of long and highly
similar repeats, making the assembly very challenging.
