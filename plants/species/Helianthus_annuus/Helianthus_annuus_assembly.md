### Assembly

DNA of the INRA inbred genotype XRQ was extracted and sequenced using 407 SMRT cells with P6/C4 chemistry. 
Subreads were obtained using the SMRT Analysis RS.Subreads.1 pipeline. In total 32.8 million subreads were 
generated with an N50 of 13.7 kb and a mean length of 10.3 kb. The targeted genome coverage of 102x was 
obtained with 367 Gb of raw sequence (340 Gb of subread data). The PBcR wgs8.3rc1 assembly pipeline was used 
to perform the correction of reads, WGS 8.3 to assemble the corrected reads and quiver to polish the consensus 
sequence after the construction of the pseudomolecules, which required physical and genetic maps. 
The final assembly included 17 pseudomolecules and 1,509 unanchored contigs.
