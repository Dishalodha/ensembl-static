### Annotation

Gene models were predicted using EuGene 4.2. The plant early release of
BUSCO (release July 2015) was run on the set of predicted transcripts,
and it detected 92% of complete gene models (590 complete single copy
and 291 duplicated, respectively) plus 10 additional fragmented gene
models.

Repeated sequences called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.or
g/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html), cover 2.25 Gb (74.8% of the genome). Low complexity (Dust) features cover 196 Mb, RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library) cover 1.94 Gb, Tandem repeats (TRF) features cover 143 Mb.
