### Annotation

Gene models were predicted using EuGene 4.2. The plant early release of
BUSCO (release July 2015) was run on the set of predicted transcripts,
and it detected 92% of complete gene models (590 complete single copy
and 291 duplicated, respectively) plus 10 additional fragmented gene
models.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There are: 3,564,833 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 238 Mb (7.9% of the genome); 1,722,940 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), covering 2131 Mb (70.4% of the genome); 1,612,551 Repeats: Red features, covering 2136 Mb (70.5% of the genome); 2057518 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 194 Mb (6.4% of the genome).
