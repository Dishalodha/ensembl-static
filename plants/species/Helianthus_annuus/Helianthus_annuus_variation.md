### Variation

A set of 11,834 SNPs called in three sunflower pre-breeding collections belonging to INTA (Argentina), INRA (France) and USDA-UBC (United States of America & Canada) was compiled to estimate the distribution pattern of global genetic diversity. A mixed genotyping strategy was implemented, by combining proprietary genotyping-by-sequencing data with public whole-genome-sequencing data from INRA and USDA-UBC accessions. The generated markers showed a uniform distribution across chromosomes, being the number of SNPs in accordance with chromosome length. This variation data data was produced in collaboration with Carla V Filippi with funding from [CABANA](https://www.cabana.online)
