### Sequence alignments

#### *Brachypodium sylvaticum* transcriptome

*De novo* gene models from the RNA-seq analysis of three [*Brachypodium
sylvaticum* populations](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4105277) were
mapped to the *B. distachyon* reference genome. Assembled data is
available from the [Jaiswal
lab](http://jaiswallab.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/genomics/brasy) and raw
reads are available from INSDC project
[PRJNA182761](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJNA182761).

#### *Triticum aestivum* transcriptome

Wheat RNA-Seq, EST and UniGene datasets have been aligned to the
*Brachypodium distachyon* genome:

-   454 Wheat RNA-seq data, from the study,
    [ERP001415](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERP001415), were
    aligned using
    [GMAP](http://www.molecularevolution.org/software/genomics/gmap).
-   All publicly available Wheat EST data were aligned using
    [Exonerate](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/%7Eguy/exonerate/), following the
    standard Ensembl pipeline.
-   Wheat UniGene cluster sequence data were aligned using
    [Exonerate](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/%7Eguy/exonerate/), following the
    standard Ensembl pipeline.
