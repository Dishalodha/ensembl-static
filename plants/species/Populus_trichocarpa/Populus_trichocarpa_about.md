About *Populus trichocarpa*
---------------------------

*Populus trichocarpa* (poplar) is a deciduous broadleaf tree that is
native to Western North America. It is an economically important source
of timber. Its rapid growth and compact genome size (\~500 Mb, n=18) has
lead to its use as a [model organism for tree
species](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/16973872).
