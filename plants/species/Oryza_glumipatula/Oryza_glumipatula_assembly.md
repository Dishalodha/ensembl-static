### Assembly

The genome sequence was generated and assembled by the [Arizona Genomics
Institute (AGI)](https://www.genome.arizona.edu/) using accession
GEN1233\_2. Illumina reads of different library sizes were assembled
with Allpaths-LG, scaffolds were constructed with SSPACE, and gaps were
closed with GapFiller. The estimated coverage from the WGS was 135x.
Total sequence length 372,860,283 bp; Number of contigs 17,912; Contig
N50: 31,921 bp.
