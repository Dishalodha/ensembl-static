### Annotation

[... Ramil ...]

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There are:
* 200408 Red features, covering 127 Mb (36.8% of the genome);
* 771011 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 30 Mb (8.6% of the genome);
* 235992 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), covering 146 Mb (42.2% of the genome);
* 243643 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 43 Mb (12.5% of the genome).
