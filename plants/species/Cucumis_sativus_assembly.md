### Assembly

The \'Chinese long\' inbred line 9930 was selected for the genome
sequencing project by the [Cucumber Genome
Initiative](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19881527). A total of 26.5
billion high-quality base pairs were generated, or 72.2-fold genome
coverage, of which the Sanger reads provided 3.9-fold coverage and the
Illumina GA reads provided 68.3-fold coverage The GA reads ranged in
length from 42 to 53 bp.

The final assembly is of length 195,669,205 bp consisting of 190
scaffolds (N50 = 29,076,228) and 11,366 contigs (N50 = 42,349).
