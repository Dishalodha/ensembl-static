**About *Hordeum vulgare***
-------------------------
Barley, a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in 
temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated 
grains; it was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent around 9000 BC, 
giving it nonshattering spikelets and making it much easier to 
harvest. Its use then spread throughout Eurasia by 2000 BC. Barley 
prefers relatively low temperatures and well-drained soil to grow. It 
is relatively tolerant of drought and soil salinity but is less 
winter-hardy than wheat or rye.
