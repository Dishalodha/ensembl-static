### Assembly

This is the assembly of cultivar Morex, a six-row malting variety, 
produced by the [International Barley Genome Sequencing
Consortium](http://barleygenome.org/ "IBSC homepage") (IBSC) using a
[hierarchical approach](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28447635).
Initially multiplexed short read BAC by BAC contig assemblies (N50: 79
kb) were scaffolded using physical, genetic and optical maps (N50: 1.9
Mb) and were assigned to chromosomes using a POPSEQ genetic map.
Finally, the linear order and orientation of scaffold sequences was
determined using [chromosome-conformation capture
sequencing](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_conformation_capture "From Wikipedia")
(Hi-C).

The final chromosome-scale assembly consisted of 6,347 ordered
super-scaffolds composed of merged assemblies of individual BACs,
representing 4.79 Gb (\~95%) of the genomic sequence content, of which
4.54 Gb have been assigned to precise chromosomal locations in the Hi-C
map.

The chloroplast genome component and its gene annotation are also
present
