### Assembly

Construction of MorexV3 pseudomolecules proceeded in several steps: 
1) Canu assembly of PacBio circular consensus reads (27x coverage);
2) scaffolding the Canu assembly with Bionano contigs;
3) removal of small redundant sequences;
4) filling gaps in scaffolds with ONT_smartdenovo contigs (resulted in 439 contigs); 
5) ordering and orienting scaffolds into chromosomal pseudomolecules with TRITEX using Hi-C data. 
The order and orientation of distal sequence in MorexV3, validated by genetic and optical maps, 
was greatly improved compared with V2.
