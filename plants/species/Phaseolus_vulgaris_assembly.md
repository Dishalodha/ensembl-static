### Assembly

An inbred landrace (G19833) derived from the Andean pool (Race Peru) was
sequenced using a whole-genome shotgun strategy that combined multiple
linear libraries (18.6x assembled sequence coverage) and ten paired
libraries of varying insert sizes sequenced with the Roche 454 platform
together with 24.1 Gb of Illumina-sequenced fragment libraries. For
longer-range linkage, three fosmid libraries and two BAC libraries on
the Sanger platform were also sequenced. The resulting assembled
sequences were organized into 11 chromosomal pseudomolecules by
integration with a dense GoldenGate- and Infinium-based SNP map of 7,015
markers from a Stampede x Red Hawk cross and a similar set of Infinium
markers and 261 SSRs (simple sequence repeats). Additional refinements
to the pseudomolecules were made on the basis of synteny with soybean
(Glycine max), where allowed by available map data. Almost all of these
changes were made in pericentromeric regions, where recombination is
generally too limited to resolve the ordering and orientation of small
scaffolds. The pseudomolecules included 468.2 Mb of mapped sequence in
240 scaffolds. The total release includes 472.5 Mb of the estimated 587
Mb genome, with half of the assembled nucleotides in contigs longer than
39.5 kb.
