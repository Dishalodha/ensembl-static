### Annotation

A total of 30,096 protein-coding genes were predicted by a combination
of de novo, homology and transcriptome-based approaches by the
[Bangladesh Jute Research
Institute](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28134914).

More than 97% of the isotigs generated from transcriptome sequencing of
seedlings aligned to the genome indicating comprehensive coverage of the
gene-rich regions. In addition, more than [97% of the conserved core
eukaryotic genes](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17332020) were
present in the genome.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 124357288 - Repeats content: 39.2%
