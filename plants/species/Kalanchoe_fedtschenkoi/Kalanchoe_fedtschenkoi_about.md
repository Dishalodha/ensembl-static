About *Kalanchoe fedtschenkoi*
------------------------------

Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a water-use efficient adaptation of photosynthesis that has evolved independently many times in diverse lineages of flowering plants. Kalanchoe fedtschenkoi, an obligate CAM species, is a model species for research into the molecular biology and functional genomics of CAM due to its relatively small diploid genome, low repetitive sequence content, and efficient stable transformation protocols.
