### Assembly

The diploid (2n=2x=34) genome size was estimated to be 260 Mb. It was assembled from 70x paired-end and 37x mate-pair reads generated using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The genome assembly consisted of 1324 scaffolds with a total length of 256 Mb and scaffold N50 of 2.45 Mb.

When compared to the grape genome, which is the best available reference for studying eudicot genome duplication events, synteny patterns reflect a 1:4 gene copy ratio between grape and *K. fedtschenkoi*.
