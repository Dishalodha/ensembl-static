### Assembly

A total of 3.7M Illumina super reads were produced with the MaSuRCA assembler, 
and then combined with 7M (35x) Oxford Nanopore Technology long reads.
Finally, the resulting mega-reads were combined to obtain a hybrid assembly, 
which comprised 1,498 scaffolds, 258 contigs, and 25,007 old scaffolds from Chandler v1.0 [2].
To improve the assembly further and build chromosome-scale scaffolds, Hi-C sequencing was applied.
The HiRise scaffolding pipeline processed 356M paired-end Illumina reads to generate the final assembly.

To assess the quality of the HiRise assembly, two genetic maps were used [3,4]. 
Almost perfect collinearity was observed between the HiRise assembly and both Chandler maps. 
Therefore, the HiRise scaffolds were oriented, ordered, and named accordingly, 
generating the final 16 chromosomal pseudomolecules.
