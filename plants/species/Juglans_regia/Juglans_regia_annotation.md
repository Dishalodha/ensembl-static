### Annotation

Full-length transcripts from single-molecule real-time sequencing were used to predict 37,554 gene models, 
with a mean gene length higher than the previous v1.0 gene annotations. Most of the new protein-coding genes (90%) 
presents both start and stop codons, which represents a significant improvement compared to Chandler v1.0. 
Of the 40,884 transcripts identified, 84% were multi-exonic, with 5.9 exons each, on average. 
Also, 2,801 gene models had from 2 to 4 transcript isoforms each, with a mean length of 9,389 bp. 

Repeated sequences were annotated with the Repeat Detector and the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html).There are: 1215333 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 52 Mb (9.0% of the genome); 213484 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), covering 79 Mb (13.8% of the genome); 473692 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 37 Mb (6.5% of the genome).
