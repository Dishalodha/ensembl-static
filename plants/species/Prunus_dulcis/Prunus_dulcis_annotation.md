### Annotation

Gene annotation was performed by combining transcript alignments,
protein alignments and ab initio gene predictions. A total of 27,969
protein-coding genes transcribing 34,039 transcripts (1.22 transcripts
per gene) and encoding for 32,559 unique protein products were produced.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: 429457 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 17 Mb (7.3% of the
genome); 74964 Repeats (ENA) features, covering 107 Mb (47.2% of the
genome); 70178 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat library), covering
21 Mb (9.2% of the genome); 2198 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase
library), covering 0 Mb (0.1% of the genome); 147273 Tandem repeats
(TRF) features, covering 13 Mb (5.6% of the genome).
