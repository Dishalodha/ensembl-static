### Annotation

Gene annotation was performed by combining transcript alignments,
protein alignments and ab initio gene predictions. A total of 27,969
protein-coding genes transcribing 34,039 transcripts (1.22 transcripts
per gene) and encoding for 32,559 unique protein products were produced.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/repeat_features). 
There are: 429,457 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 17 Mb (7.3% 
of the genome); 159,501 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), 
covering 90 Mb (39.4% of the genome); 70,178 RepeatMasker features 
(with the REdat library), covering 21 Mb (9.2% of the genome); 147,273 
Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 13 Mb (5.6% of the genome).
