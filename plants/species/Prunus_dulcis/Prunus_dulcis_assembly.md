### Assembly

A total of 138.6 Gb of Illumina (\>500x) and 10.2 Gb (37x) of Oxford
Nanopore Technologies sequence of the highly heterozygous *Prunus
dulcis* cv. Texas were produced. By analyzing k-mer frequency, the lower
bound for genome size was estimated to be 238 Mb. The assembly was
collapsed into a haploid representation and anchored it to eight
pseudomolecules. The v.2.0 assembly (also known as pdulcis26) totals
227.6 Mb (91.5% of which is anchored to the eight pseudomolecules) and
has a contig and scaffold N50s of 103.9 and 381.5 kb, respectively. The
BUSCO completeness of the assembly is 96.4%.
