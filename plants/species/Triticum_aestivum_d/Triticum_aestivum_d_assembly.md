Assemblies
----------

Chromosome survey sequences for bread wheat cv Chinese Spring have been
generated by the [International Wheat Genome Sequencing
Consortium](http://www.wheatgenome.org/). [The Genome Analysis
Centre](http://www.tgac.ac.uk/) has provided an assembly of these survey
sequences, which is now available through Ensembl Plants. \~11 millions
contigs and \~10 millions scaffolds were generated with a contig N50 of
2.4kb. Due to the large number of scaffolds, we have only loaded a
subset, comprising all scaffolds equal or greater than 3kb and
additionnally, all scaffolds to which wheat cDNA alignments have been
made (leading to a total of \~710,000 scaffolds loaded in the database).
The set of scaffolds that was loaded has been included in the [Ensembl
Plants BLAST](http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum/blastview) and
[ENA search](http://dev.ensemblgenomes.org/node/ENA%20search)
facilities.

The complete set of survey sequences may be downloaded from [The Genome
Analysis Centre](http://opendata.tgac.ac.uk/iwgsc/css/v1/), and can be
searched using the [TGAC blast
server](http://tgac-browser.tgac.ac.uk/iwgsc_css/blast.jsp). The data
will be available shortly in the archives of the International
Nucleotide Sequence Database Consortium.
