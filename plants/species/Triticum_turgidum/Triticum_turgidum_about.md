About *Triticum turgidum*
-------------------------

Durum wheat with a total production of about 35 million tons is the 10th
most important crops worldwide. It is an integral component of the
Mediterranean diet and one of the historical foods that followed the
birth of civilization, likely to be one of the first domesticated crops
in the Fertile Crescent. Durum is a tetraploid wheat with a genome of
about 12 Gb, domesticated from wild emmer in the Fertile Crescent about
10,000 years ago. Further, it is an integral component of the
Mediterranean diet and it is the historical food that followed the birth
of civilization in the Fertile Crescent. From here it expanded to
Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it is today cultivated
across the globe. The domestication process and the subsequent breeding
activity have selected the modern durum wheat fixing the typical
domestication traits (e.g. brittle rachis, naked seeds and
threshability), agronomic traits (e.g. short straw and disease
resistances) as well as specific pasta quality traits (grain hardness,
pigment content, protein content).\[1\]
