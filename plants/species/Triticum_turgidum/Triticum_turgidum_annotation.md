### Annotation

Annotation of the Svevo genome led to the identification of 66,559 high
confidence (HC) genes, 90.5% of which exhibited detectable evidence of
expression in at least one of the 21 RNA-seq datasets listed
[here](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41588-019-0381-3/MediaObjects/41588_2019_381_MOESM7_ESM.xlsx).

Ensembl Plants display the HC genes alongside 303,404 low confidence
genes (LC) marked as alternative genes on the website.
