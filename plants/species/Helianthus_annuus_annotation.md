### Annotation

Gene models were predicted using EuGene 4.2. The plant early release of
BUSCO (release July 2015) was run on the set of predicted transcripts,
and it detected 92% of complete gene models (590 complete single copy
and 291 duplicated, respectively) plus 10 additional fragmented gene
models.
