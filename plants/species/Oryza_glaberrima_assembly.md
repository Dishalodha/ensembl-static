### Assembly

The genome sequence was generated and assembled by the [Arizona Genomics
Institute (AGI)](https://www.genome.arizona.edu/) using strain
IRGC:96717. The current assembly is Oryza\_glaberrima\_AGI1.1. It
incorporates the previously assembled chromosome 3 short arm (Chr3s)
sequence and consists of 12 chromosome pseudomolecules and 1,939
unplaced scaffolds. Chr3s was sequenced and assembled using a heavily
manually edited physical map. BAC clones were shotgun Sanger sequenced
to 8x coverage and phase II finished. Assembly of the tile sequence was
performed manually. The rest of the genome was sequenced with a hybrid
BAC pooling and whole genome shotgun approach with 30x coverage of Roche
GSFLX 454 Titanium sequencing technology. Sequences were assembled and
combined with a subset of previously sequenced BAC clones to produce a
whole genome assembly. The underlying scaffolds have been deposited in
GenBank with the accession number ADWL01000000.
