About *Secale cereale*
---------------------
Rye (Secale cereale L.), a member of the grass tribe Triticeae and close relative of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), is grown primarily for human consumption and animal feed. Rye is uniquely stress tolerant (biotic and abiotic) and thus shows high yield potential under marginal conditions. This makes rye an important crop along the northern boreal-hemiboreal belt, a climatic zone predicted to expand considerably in Eurasia and North America with anthropogenic global warming1. Currently, rye is produced on [4.1 million ha](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/), 81% of which is in northeastern Europe.
