### Assembly
De novo scaffolds where assembled representing 6.74 Gb of the estimated 7.9 Gb ‘Lo7’ genome from >1.8 Tb of short-read sequence. These scaffolds were ordered, oriented and curated using: (1) chromosome-specific shotgun (CSS) reads8, (2) 10x Chromium linked reads, (3) genetic map markers9, (4) three-dimensional chromosome conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C)18 and (5) a Bionano optical genome map. After intensive manual curation, 92% of this assembled sequence (~78% of the estimated genome size) was arranged first into super-scaffolds (N50 > 29 megabases, Mb) and then into pseudomolecules. Shotgun reads (~947 Gb of data, ~120× mean depth-of coverage) were mapped back to the assembly to confirm a near-unimodal coverage distribution consistent with a high-quality assembly.
