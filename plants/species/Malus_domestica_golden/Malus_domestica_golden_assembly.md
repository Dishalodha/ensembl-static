### Assembly

This genome sequence corresponds to a homozygous, doubled haploid of
'Golden Delicious', cultivar GDDH13, also coded X9273. This is assembly
version GDDH13 version 1.0. Three different technologies (paired-end,
mate-pair and optical mapping) were combined for the assembly of DNA
from leaves. In total, 120-fold coverage of Illumina paired-end reads
(72 Gb), 80-fold coverage of Illumina Nextera mate-pair reads (58 Gb,
insert sizes 2, 5 and 10 kb) and 35-fold coverage of PacBio sequencing
data (24 Gb) were obtained. Paired-end reads were first assembled using
SOAPdenovo, and the resulting contigs were combined with the PacBio
reads using DBG2OLC. The mate-pair reads were used for scaffolding with
BESST. Finally, a 600-fold coverage BioNano optical map was integrated
to generate a consensus map that resulted in an assembly of 649.7 Mb.
This consensus map was then used for the hybrid assembly with the
corrected scaffolds, which, together with SNPs derived from a
high-density genetic linkage map, allowed the construction of the 17
pseud-chromosomes. The estimated genome size of 651 Mb is very close to
the 649.7-Mb size in the consensus map.
