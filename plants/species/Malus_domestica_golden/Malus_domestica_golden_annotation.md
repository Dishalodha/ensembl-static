### Annotation

A high-throughput RNA-seq analysis on poly(A)-enriched RNAs from nine
libraries that originated from different genotypes and tissues was
carried out. Reads were assembled, and the resulting contigs were mapped
to the scaffolds and integrated in the EuGene combiner pipeline. In
total, 42,140 protein-coding genes were identified. Evidence of
transcription was found for 93% of the annotated genes, with 94,9%
complete BUSCOs v2. Genes in unplaced contigs (Chr0) have not been
imported.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: 982556 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 109 Mb (15.5% of
the genome); 218553 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat library),
covering 87 Mb (12.4% of the genome); 458059 RepeatMasker features (with
the RepBase library), covering 305 Mb (43.4% of the genome); 421645
Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 46 Mb (6.5% of the genome).
