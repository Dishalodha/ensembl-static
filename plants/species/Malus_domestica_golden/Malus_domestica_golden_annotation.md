### Annotation

A high-throughput RNA-seq analysis on poly(A)-enriched RNAs from nine
libraries that originated from different genotypes and tissues was
carried out. Reads were assembled, and the resulting contigs were mapped
to the scaffolds and integrated in the EuGene combiner pipeline. In
total, 42,140 protein-coding genes were identified. Evidence of
transcription was found for 93% of the annotated genes, with 94,9%
complete BUSCOs v2. Genes in unplaced contigs (Chr0) have not been
imported.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/repeat_features). There are: 982,556 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 109 Mb (15.5% of the genome); 341,667 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), covering 326 Mb (46.4% of the genome); 218,553 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library), covering 87 Mb (12.4% of the genome); 421,645 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 46 Mb (6.5% of the genome).
