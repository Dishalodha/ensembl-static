### Assembly

*C. braunii* features a haplontic life cycle; this draft sequence here
represents a haploid genome. The observed chromosome number (n=14)
corresponds to the base chromosome number of *Chara* species. Genomic
DNA of the uni-algal strain S276 isolated from Lake Kasumigaura
(Ibaraki, Japan) was sequenced as the reference genome using Illumina
technology and sequences were compared with those of the strain S277
that was isolated from the pond at Ehime (Japan). Approximately 0.25 Gbp
of scaffolds were present in only one of the datasets and found to be of
bacterial origin. After removal of these prokaryotic sequences, 1.75 Gbp
of scaffold data (N50 size of 2.26 Mbp) were obtained, of which 1.43 Gbp
were assembled into contigs. This corresponds to ∼74% of the genome as
measured by flow cytometry (1.89-1.96 Gbp) and to ∼61% of the 2.35 Gbp
estimated by k-mer analysis.
