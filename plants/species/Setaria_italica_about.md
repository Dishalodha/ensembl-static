About *Setaria italica*
-----------------------

*Setaria italica* (foxtail millet) is a grain crop widely grown in Asia
with particular significance in semi-arid regions of Northern China. It
is also grown on a moderate scale in other parts of the world as a
forage crop. It is one of the oldest domesticated crops with
archeological remains from 5,500 to 5,900 years BC in northern China.
Motivation for sequencing foxtail millet includes its close
relationship, both genetically and physiologically, to the biofuel crop
switchgrass (*Panicum virgatum*). Direct study of switchgrass is
complicated by its large genome size and polyploidy. Data from the
foxtail millet genome assists in study and improvement of switchgrass
and related biofuel crops. The nuclear genome (\~490 Mb) is diploid with
nine chromosomes (2n=18).
