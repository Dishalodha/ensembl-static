About *Eragrostis curvula*
--------------------------

Weeping lovegrass (*Eragrostis curvula*) is a C4 perennial grass member
of the Poaceae family, Chloridoideae subfamily. The E. curvula complex
has a basic chromosome number of x = 10 and includes cytotypes with
different ploidy levels (from 2x to 8x) that may undergo sexual
reproduction and facultative or obligate apomixis. Its drought tolerance
and capacity to grow in sandy soils make it highly valued, especially
for cattle feed in semiarid regions.
