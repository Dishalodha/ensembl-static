### Assembly

Genome sequencing was performed by the [Potato Genome Sequencing
Consortium](http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44344811) using a BAC
libary, fingerprinted and aligned into physical map contigs. This was
complemented by whole genome shotgun approaches with 454 and Illumina
sequencing.
