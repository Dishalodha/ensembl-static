### Annotation

Annotation was carried out by the [Potato Genome Sequencing
Consortium](http://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44344811) using
Cyrille2.

Additional analysis was carried out in house: non coding RNA genes have
been annotated using
[tRNAScan-SE](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC146525),
[Rfam](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15608160), and
[RNAmmer](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1888812).
