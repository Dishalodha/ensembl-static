About *Malus domestica*
-----------------------

Apple (*Malus domestica*) is usually a diploid species (2n = 2x = 34)
that belongs to the Rosaceae family. It is one of the most famous fruits
globally and occupies a central position in folklore, culture, and art.
Apple varieties have retained high genetic and phenotypic diversity,
evidenced by the high number of apple varieties cultivated today. Like
most other fruit tree crops, apple is propagated by grafting onto
rootstocks, which over time can allow the acquisition and propagation of
epimutations, via variation in DNA methylation states that can influence
various phenotypes, such as fruit color.
