### Annotation

A total of 27,852 protein-coding genes and 28,689 protein-coding
transcripts were predicted by
[JGI.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23525075)

Predictions began with PASA transcript assemblies based on ESTs from
peach and related species. Transcript assemblies and a collection of
plant peptide sequences were blasted against the assembly and gene
models were predicted using by homology-based predictors FGENESH+ and
GenomeScan. Predicted gene models were improved and refined by PASA.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 74986019 - Repeats content: 32.9%
