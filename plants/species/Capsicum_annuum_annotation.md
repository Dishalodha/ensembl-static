### Annotation

A total of 34,903 protein-coding genes were predicted in the Pepper
Genome Annotation (PGA). These were subsequently evaluated using 19.8 Gb
of Illumina RNA-seq data. Overall, 93.2% of the predicted coding
sequences were supported by Illumina data, demonstrating the high
accuracy of gene prediction by PGA. Manual curation was used to improve
gene models.
