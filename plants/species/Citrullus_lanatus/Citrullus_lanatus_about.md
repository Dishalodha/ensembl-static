About *Citrullus lanatus*
-------------------------

*Citrullus lanatus* (Watermelon, 2n=2x=22) is one of the most popular fruit crops worldwide. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family and originated in Africa. It has been domesticated for more than 4,000 years, and has been improved by domestication and breeding from wild watermelons with small fruits harboring hard, pale-colored and bitter- or bland-tasting flesh, into modern sweet watermelons carrying large fruits with crisp sweet and red flesh and a thin rind.
