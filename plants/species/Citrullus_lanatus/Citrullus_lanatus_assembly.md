### Assembly

The version 2 of the genome of east Asia cultivar 97103 was de novo assembled using PacBio long reads, combined with BioNano optical and Hi-C chromatin interaction maps. A total of 20.3 Gb PacBio sequences were generated with an N50 length of 10.8 kb, covering 47.2x of the genome. The resulting assembly had a total size of 359.8 Mb, containing 367 contigs with an N50 size of 2.3 Mb. A total of 410.7 Gb cleaned BioNano optical map data were generated and de novo assembled into BioNano genome maps, which were used to connect PacBio assembled contigs, resulting in 149 scaffolds with an N50 size of 21.9 Mb and a cumulative length of 365.1 Mb. Furthermore, 135.2M cleaned Hi-C reads were generated, of which 92.1M (68.1%) were uniquely mapped to the assembly, which resulted in a final of 69.5M valid read pairs. The Hi-C data, combined with previously published genetic maps were used to order and orient the scaffolds into chromosome-scale pseudomolecules. Finally, 31 scaffolds with a total size of 362.7 Mb (99.3% of the assembly) were clustered into 11 chromosomes ranging from 27.1 to 37.9 Mb in length.
