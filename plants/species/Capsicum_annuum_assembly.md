### Assembly

Mexican landrace Criollo de Morelos 334 (CM334) was used to generate
650.2 Gb (186x coverage) of whole-genome shotgun sequence by Illumina
sequencing of genomic libraries with insert sizes ranging from 180 bp to
20 kb. After filtering, a 3.06 Gb assembly was obtained with SOAPdenovo
and SSPACE, containing 37,989 scaffolds (N50=2.47 Mb), of which 1,276
contained of 90% of the genome sequence. A high-density genetic map with
6,281 markers using 120 recombinant inbred lines was used to anchor
scaffolds. A total of 1.048 scaffolds (75.6% of the genome) were ordered
along 12 chromosome pseudomolecules.
