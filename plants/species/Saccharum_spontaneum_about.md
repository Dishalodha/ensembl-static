About *Saccharum spontaneum*
----------------------------

*Saccharum spontaneum* is a sugar-poor relative of sugarcane which
breeders have backcrossed for traits such as hardiness, disease
resistance or ratooning capacity. It belongs to the PACMAD clade within
grasses (Poaceae). This is a Hi-C-based genome assembly of one haploid
individual (AP85-441, 1n =​ 4x =​ 32). The genome size was estimated to
be 3.36 Gbp by flow cytometry. This genome is an international
collaboration led by Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University,
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Hawaii Agriculture
Research Center.
