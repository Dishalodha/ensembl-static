### Annotation

[Protein-coding genes were
annotated](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23481403) using an
evidence-based approach as implemented in the
[Gramene](http://www.gramene.org/) gene-build pipeline by collaboration
with Dr. Chengzhi Liang at IGDB. [Transposable
elements](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23481403) were annotated by
collaboration with [Dr. Scott A. Jackson at University of
Georgia](http://www.plantbreeding.uga.edu/people/jacksonPBGGatCAESUGA.html).
Non coding RNA genes were predicted with Infernal and tRNA genes with
tRNAscan at [Arizona Genomics Institute
(AGI)](http://www.genome.arizona.edu/) led by Dr. Rod Wing.
