### Annotation

34,879 protein-coding genes were predicted by [Ling *et
al*](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23535596). (2013), using an *ab
initio* approach with sequence similarity and RNA-seq data.

Additional analysis was carried out in house: non coding RNA genes have
been annotated using
[tRNAScan-SE](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC146525),
[Rfam](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15608160), and
[RNAmmer](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1888812). Triticeae Repeats
from [*TREP*](http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ITMI/Repeats/) were aligned to
the *T. urartu* genome using RepeatMasker.
