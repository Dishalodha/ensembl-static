About *Chara braunii*
---------------------

*Chara braunii* belongs to class Charophyceae, a class of charophyte
green algae, commonly known as stoneworts and brittleworts.
Charophyceae have the most complex body plans among charophytic algae.
The haploid thallus body plan encompasses a shoot-like axis consisting
of nodes with whorls, internodes, a simplex apical meristem, and
multicellular rhizoids. Their genomes have been compared to those of
land plants to identify evolutionary novelties for plant
terrestrialization.
