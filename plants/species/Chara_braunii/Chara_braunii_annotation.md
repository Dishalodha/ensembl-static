### Annotation

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of vegetative and reproductive stages was used
together with full-length cDNA sequences to annotate the genome with
AUGUSTUS. In total 23,546 putative protein-coding gene models were
identified, of which 53% are supported by RNA-seq data. At least 94% of
several conserved core gene sets are encoded by the genome, indicating
its suitability for genomic and comparative analyses.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: 3043731 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 436 Mb (24.9% of
the genome); 817800 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat library),
covering 126 Mb (7.2% of the genome); 207059 RepeatMasker features (with
the RepBase library), covering 26 Mb (1.5% of the genome); 1784326
Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 160 Mb (9.1% of the genome);
Repeat Detector repeats length 788Mb (45.05% of the genome).
